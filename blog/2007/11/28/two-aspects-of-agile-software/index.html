1. Management aspects
I encapsulate the things like working on a story by story basis, standing up for daily status update meeting, producing deliveries in short iterations and without much of prior planning into this group."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.109.0"><meta name=robots content="noindex, nofollow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.css><meta property="og:title" content="Two Aspects of Agile Software Development Process"><meta property="og:description" content="I have been in practice with the famous agile software development process called &#34;Scrum&#34; for more than a year.
