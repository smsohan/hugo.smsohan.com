Objects are designed to be interacting with each other following two rules of thumb "Highest Cohesion" and "Lowest coupling". So, a class instead of taking all the responsibilities only takes care of some high cohesive ones and depends on other partner classes for the rest of the services. This dependency creates a graph like structure with objects as the nodes and dependencies as the edges.<br><br>2. We expect our classes to "take only single responsibility" and "encapsulate anything that varies" to make sure we have good compact manageable classes. But this at the same time means a lot of new dependencies resulting in a complex graph of objects. The more one class is used and reused we have even more complex graph..<br><br><br>This dependency graph stands in a cut-point of the two conflicting interests. A class with less dependency makes it easy to "test", but a class with less dependency "looses re-usability". Because, once a class has a lot of dependencies, its hard to isolate an independent part of the class and test. On the other hand, if a class has only a few dependencies, its likely that the class is doing a lot of stuffs itself and so, has many reasons to change.<br><br>Now to break the trade-off, I consider the key points again. If a class is high cohesive, it must depend on other classes for some non-cohesive services. This will also break down the classes into smaller classes which are more likely to be reusable than the longer ones. So, I have the feeling that dependencies are not that bad.<br><br>Now, the problem boils down to testing a class with all the dependencies on other classes. Well, we cannot actually delete the dependencies, still, we can inject them!<br><br>I hope to follow up on my understanding on dependency injection soon in my future posts.</div><h2>Comments</h2><div class=comments><div class=comment><div class=author>hellosaru</div><div class=content><i>hi</i></div></div><div class=comment><div class=author>lijiale</div><div class=content>The story is about a very small (<a href=http://www.powerleveling-wowgold.com/ rel=nofollow>wow gold</a>)because the (<a href=http://www.wow-powerleveling-wow.com/ rel=nofollow>wow gold</a>)reasons for the (<a href=http://www.cheapestwowgold.org/ rel=nofollow>wow gold</a>) expulsion Chushi doors have been forced to(<a href=http://www.powerleveling-wowgold.com/ rel=nofollow>wow power leveling</a>) living on the United Kingdom, (<a href=http://www.wow-powerleveling-wow.com/ rel=nofollow>wow power leveling</a>)in abroad alone the people(<a href=http://www.cheapestwowgold.org/ rel=nofollow>wow power leveling</a>) struggling for survival.
