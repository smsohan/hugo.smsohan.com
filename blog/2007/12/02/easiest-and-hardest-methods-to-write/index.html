b. A method that takes some parameters, and limits its operations only on the supplied parameters and local variables and returns some value or throws exception is also very easy to write a test for."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.121.2"><meta name=robots content="noindex, nofollow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.css><meta property="og:title" content="The Easiest and the Hardest Methods to write unit test for"><meta property="og:description" content="I was wondering to find out the easiest methods to write unit tests for.

But the reality is, we cannot always have the most convenient forms for unit testing with real life methods.<br><br>And things start to go wrong as we have deviations from the ideal. Some of the most commonly found deviations are -<br>1. void methods that optionally throws exception<br>2. void methods without exceptions<br>3. Methods without parameters.<br>4. Methods having multilevel nesting and complex flow.<br>5. Methods that depends on other methods or classes or modules.<br>6. Methods having dependency on static methods.<br>7. Methods with a risk of runtime exception.<br><br>I will be posting rescue scenarios with appropriate reasoning to get around to the discomforts of the above listed deviations from ideal unit testing perspectives.<br><br>Stay tuned to get more on this...:-)</div><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-navy bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://smsohan.com/>&copy; Sohan's Blog 2024</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
