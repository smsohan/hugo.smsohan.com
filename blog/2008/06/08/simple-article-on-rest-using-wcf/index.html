MSDN has a good document on the whole WebGet and WebInvoke attributes. However, the article on <a title=http://blogs.conchango.com/anthonysteele/archive/2008/03/15/rest-from-wcf-3-5.aspx href=http://blogs.conchango.com/anthonysteele/archive/2008/03/15/rest-from-wcf-3-5.aspx>http://blogs.conchango.com/anthonysteele/archive/2008/03/15/rest-from-wcf-3-5.aspx</a> shows nearly the simplest implementation of a mini RESTful architecture. I think, one might take a look at the article and get a good head-start!</p></div><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-navy bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://smsohan.com/>&copy; Sohan's Blog 2023</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
