But this doesn't solve all the problems. You will soon discover that, your application doesn't show an error when you write C# 3.0 code with the target framework set to 2.0. This is because, the IDE by default uses the latest language version by default.</p><p>To solve this problem, Navigate to <span style=color:#8080ff><strong>project properties > Build > Advanced > Language Version and choose ISO-2 (or ISO-1).</strong></span> Now with this information, the VS 2008 will start showing compiler errors for features that don't comply to the version specification!</p></div><h2>Comments</h2><div class=comments><div class=comment><div class=author>Jeff Sinclair</div><div class=content>The important thing to remember is that if you compile using c# 3.0 features, this does not mean that the compiled output won't run on 2.0 Most of the c# 3 features are compile time only.<br>Be clear on if you want to be restricted at compile time, or if your goal is to have the output work on 2.0 at runtime.</div></div></div><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-navy bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://smsohan.com/>&copy; Sohan's Blog 2023</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
