Well, you are not alone. You know, most of your bugs could be killed by reviews. Most of your technical debts could be paid by reviews. Your team could collectively learn more by reviews...

I have found the following approach to be useful-</p><ol><li>Pair up with one developer. Make it explicit to the team. So, you know who reviews your code.</li><li>Mix up a junior team member with a senior one, if possible.</li><li>Have a fixed time, at least 30 minutes for each two weeks to do a team design/code review.</li><li>Do it in small increments. We did the following-</li></ol><ul><ul><li>Sprint#1: Review variable/method/class/file/folder names only.</li><li>Sprint#2: #1 + Review if/else blocks, loops.</li><li>Sprint#3: #2 + Review class responsibilities.</li><li>Sprint#4: #3 + Review test codes only.</li></ul></ul><p><strong><span style=color:green>The result is really worth</span></strong></p><p>This first level feedback will help you to eliminate a lot of bugs, help in knowledge transfer and collective learning. Roughly, It takes only 10-15 minutes to review a code written in 3 days. I suggest, keep it simple.</p><p>One interesting thing is, many times I have found the developer him/herself actually found bugs/mistakes in the code before the reviewer at the time or reviewing.</p><p><span style=color:green><strong>A reviewer's eye will save lot of your time and money.</strong></span></p><p><span style=color:green><strong>Update: Be constructive in your feedback!
