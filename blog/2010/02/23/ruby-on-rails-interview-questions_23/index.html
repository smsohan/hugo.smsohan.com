But I have found most people asking questions about scalability, deployment issues, security and such architectural level questions to extract out the in-depth understanding of such core concepts. Where to learn more on such advanced stuffs?&nbsp;<a href=http://guides.rubyonrails.org/>Ruby on Rails Guides</a> and <a href=http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ruby-on-rails>Stack Overflow</a> are my favorite places.
