The solution is to wisely use flash.now[] and flash[]. Here are a few tips:<br><br><b>Use flash.now[] when you are flashing:</b><br><br><ul><li>on ajax requests</li><li>before a call to render :action => :my_action, as often found in failure cases of create and update actions</li></ul><b>Use flash[] when you are flashing:</b><br><br><ul><li>before a redirect_to, often found in the success cases of create and update actions</li></ul><div>In general, use flash.now[] when you don't want to carry over the flash to the next http request and flash[] otherwise. The FlashHash class has more detail on this<a href=http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Flash/FlashHash.html> at the ruby on rails API page</a>. Hope this helps you to get rid of those annoying and often embarrassing out-of-context flash messages!</div></div><h2>Comments</h2><div class=comments><div class=comment><div class=author>Sohan</div><div class=content>Thanks Severin for your comment and pointing the typo.</div></div><div class=comment><div class=author>Severin</div><div class=content>Helpful explanation, thanks!<br><br>But there's a little typo: "Use flash.NEW[]..." should be "Use flash.NOW[]..."</div></div><div class=comment><div class=author>Sohan</div><div class=content>Hi Arif, you are welcome.
