I had troubles with Authlogic as it shows Based.named_scope is DEPRICATED. Still looking for a solution.</li><li>Ruby 1.9.2 doesn't work with soap42 wsdl driver. Haven't found a solution yet as it keeps reporting an error regarding "XML processor module" missing.</li></ol><div>Upgrading your controllers:</div><div><ol><li>Find out all occurrences of find method and replace with where.</li><li>Find out all calls to Mailer that looks like deliver_xxx and make it xxx.deliver</li></ol><div><div><div>Upgrading your views:</div></div><div><ol><li>All erb blocks must start with a has to be changed to&nbsp; .

It is not included by default, so your code from the lib folder won't be accessible.</li><li>Look at deprecation warning and you will see lots of config.action_controller.* need to changed to config.*</li></ol><div>Plugins:</div></div><div><ol><li>All plugin/lib/rails/tasks/*.rake needs to be copied in to plugin/lib/tasks/*.rake</li><li>Make sure your plugins don't use named_scope, if you find any, replace with scope.</li><li>Whatever applies to your models should also be applied to your plugins that act on models.</li></ol><div>Testing:</div><div><ol><li>Check you have updated shoulda, rspec or whatever lib you use.</li><li>Update test codes according to your new lib.</li></ol></div><div>Upgrading IDE to use RVM:</div></div><div><ol><li>Your IDE is not smart enough to use RVM.
