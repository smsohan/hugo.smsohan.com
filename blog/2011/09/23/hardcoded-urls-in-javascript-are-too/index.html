I was working on a web project that lets you delete some records using Ajax. The following is just an example, but you might be familiar with a similar code already:
This code used to work when the DELETE endpoint was indeed under '/blog/posts'. However, at some point a developer wants to remove the '/blog' from all the endpoints to put them directly under '/posts'! You can see, in such cases it is very hard to catch the bug that would be caused by the faulty JS code."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.109.0"><meta name=robots content="noindex, nofollow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.css><meta property="og:title" content="Hardcoded URLs in Javascript are too Slippery"><meta property="og:description" content="Photo credits to&nbsp;Esteban Cavrico

But its also dangerous, because its hard to catch/fix these defects since they can be buried deep under an untested Javascript file. Instead feed this data from your server side code and you'll mitigate risk that way.<br><br></div></div></div><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-navy bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://smsohan.com/>&copy; Sohan's Blog 2023</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
