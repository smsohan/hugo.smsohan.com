To make it easy to understand, let&rsquo;s build an example, simple enough to isolate the topic of interest.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s say we have a list of locations, stored in a database table as follows:</p><pre><code>Locations (location_id (primary key), province_id (NULL), city_id (NOT NULL))
</code></pre><p>And say, we want to present a list of locations sorted by &ldquo;address&rdquo;. As you see in this example, &ldquo;address&rdquo; is a concept, not directly present in the database, but can be derived based on province_id and city_id. So, when we say sort by &ldquo;address&rdquo;, the SQL query may look like the follwing:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-sql data-lang=sql><span style=display:flex><span>  <span style=color:#66d9ef>SELECT</span> <span style=color:#f92672>*</span> <span style=color:#66d9ef>FROM</span> Locations <span style=color:#66d9ef>order</span> <span style=color:#66d9ef>by</span> province_id, city_id
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now, if you take a second look at the schema, you&rsquo;ll see the <code>province_id</code> is <code>Nullable</code>. And if you are familiar with SQL, you already know that a <code>NULL</code> does not equal another <code>NULL</code>. So, for rows with <code>province_id = NULL</code>, the secondary sort on city_id has no effect at all. As a result, the expected sort by &ldquo;address&rdquo; cannot be derived by using this simple <code>order by</code> clause.</p><p>There are a few work arounds to it. One obvious workaround is to change the DB schema and make the <code>province_id</code> NOT NULL in favor of a placeholder, for example, &ldquo;Not Available&rdquo;. This would eliminate the problem altogether. This should be pretty easy to achieve if you have control over the database schema.</p><p>But in case this is beyond your control, you&rsquo;d have to hack your query and sleep with the noisy butterfly in your stomach. Such a poorman&rsquo;s solution would be to put a <code>&ldquo;case &mldr; when &mldr; else&mldr; end&mldr;"</code> in the query.</p><p>The reason I wanted to share this post is, if your project needs to sort by such a computed concept, here&rsquo;s what you should probably:</p><ol><li>Say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to it.</li><li>Change your database to incorporate the concept as a column in some table.</li><li>At the very least, make sure you&rsquo;re not sorting on a Nullable field.</li><li>Repeat 1-3 in order.</li></ol><p>Thanks for reading.
