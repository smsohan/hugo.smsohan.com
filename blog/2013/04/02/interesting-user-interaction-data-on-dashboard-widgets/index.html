As security products go, we collect a huge amount of data about events that happen on the user devices so we can identify and potentially quarantine malicuous events.

The target is to offer a very high level, but an actionable view of the whole enterprise data. In the end we settled down with a list of 7 types of data and decided to use a layout similar to the following.</p><p><img src=/images/dashboard_layout.png alt=Layout></p><p>I was looking at the metrics this morning to see if our prioritization of the layout tiles made sense to the users and found that</p><blockquote><p>the number of clicks on each widget is highly correlated to its relative order in the layout.</p></blockquote><p>I am not sure how to interpret this result. It may mean one of:</p><ol><li>The ordering of the tiles matches the actual priority of our users.</li><li>Irrespective of the contents, users are more likely to click on data in this order.</li><li>The results are totally random and it&rsquo;s more of a coincidence over a correlation.</li></ol><p>At this point, I feel we need to shuffle the tiles to see if the position has a strong bias on the results. When I get a chance to do this, will post again with my findings.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-navy bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://smsohan.com/>&copy; Sohan's Blog 2024</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
