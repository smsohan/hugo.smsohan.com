To recap, the top story of 2013 was of course the birth of our son, Shopoth. And then, we bought our first house, paid off our car-loan and ended the year with a much needed vacation, that too to Bangladesh where we spent some quality time with the families.</p><p>2013 was my year of learning Haskell. I can&rsquo;t claim to be a seasoned Haskell programmer yet. But I think I learned a lot of new concepts that you only see once you&rsquo;re left in the unchartered territory of a functional programming language. So, in 2014, Haskell still remains a the language I want to get better at.</p><p>I&rsquo;d like to change a few things in 2014 in terms of my career. It&rsquo;s been almost 8 years since I&rsquo;ve been developing web apps on the job. It&rsquo;s been exciting and I feel overwhelmed when I look back at how far the industry has matured over the years. However, at the same time, <strong>in 2014, I&rsquo;d like to focus on my soft-skills, especially on my negotiation skills</strong>. The target is to practice negotiation before I need to negotiate with others, so I&rsquo;m well prepared to share my opinion about a topic. And afterwards, do a retrospective to find out room for improvement.</p><p>In 2013, I also got a PhD admission at the University of Calgary. So far, I&rsquo;ve enrolled into only a single course. But the target is to publish one paper on API evolution by the end of this summer.</p><p>2014 is the first year of my thirties. I guess, <strong>I should start checking off items from my bucket list</strong> from now on. Still debating which one to target in 2014: a) learn to fly an airplane, b) start my own side project. Will keep you posted when I&rsquo;ve made my mind. Happy 2014 till then.</p><p>Oh, before I conclude, here&rsquo;s some stats about my open source contribution in 2013:</p><ol><li>40K+ downloads of <a href=http://www.nuget.org/packages/MvcMailer>MvcMailer</a></li><li>400+ downloads of <a href=http://www.nuget.org/packages/TextHelper>TextHelper</a></li><li>1.5K+ downloads of <a href=http://rubygems.org/gems/streamy_csv>streamy_csv</a></li><li>17K+ visits to <a href=/blog>my blog</a></li></ol><p>In 2014, I&rsquo;d like to continue my open source contribution, preferably to some well established projects.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-navy bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://smsohan.com/>&copy; Sohan's Blog 2023</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
