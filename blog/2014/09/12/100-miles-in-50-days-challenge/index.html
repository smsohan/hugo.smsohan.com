Here&rsquo;s a photo of day 2, when I ran my first 5K in years.
Last year I decided to change the focus. Instead of aiming for weightloss, I started aiming for a better lifestyle. To some extent, that worked. But I can&rsquo;t say it really made a big difference of any sort.
I always thought I was a team sport person and hated doing anything only by myself, so much so that, I need a partner even for swimming."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.121.2"><meta name=robots content="noindex, nofollow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.css><meta property="og:title" content="100 Miles in 50 Days Challenge"><meta property="og:description" content="Weightloss is a tough chase.

But I can&rsquo;t say it really made a big difference of any sort.</p><p>I always thought I was a team sport person and hated doing anything only by myself, so much so that, I need a partner even for swimming. After an introspection, I realized that, this is not gonna work, and things needed to change if I really wanted a better lifestyle.</p><p>In came the Treadmill. A second hand, barely used, Livestrong treadmill on a discount price of $400 (new one costs $1,700). Having this in the basement, overlooking the wall mounted TV, makes it such a big difference. Specially in a place like Calgary, where a lot of preparation is required to set foot out of the door in the winter months.</p><p>After I bought the Treadmill in October 2013, I ran my first 100 miles on it in the next 4 months, running 2 miles on each session. It felt so good every time I completed the 2 miles. The confidence found from this first 100 miles shapes my next goal.</p><blockquote><p>Run 100 miles in 50 day challenge</p></blockquote><p>Today is day 4. I&rsquo;ve completed 9 miles or 9% so far. Hoping to report back once I&rsquo;ve reached 50%.</p><p>Hope this gets you started if you are thinking about a change and like taking a challenge. If you are taking this challenge, let&rsquo;s team up and keep each other motivated along the way.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-navy bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://smsohan.com/>&copy; Sohan's Blog 2024</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
