This was a strict business requirement, because having a separate server to store your 2nd-factor authorization provides additional security in case the servers hosting your primary factor are compromised.</p><p>We operate on a cloud environment, so spinning up new servers is a simple process. The source code for this whole Ruby on Rails based two-step verification service is no more than a couple hundred lines. So, in theory, it should be very easy to deploy such a service. However, it proved to be a lot of work in the end.</p><p>For example, to deploy this service, we actually had to spin <strong>a few servers</strong> for each of our staging and production environments. They also had to be <strong>load balanced</strong> for obvious reasons. They needed their <strong>own database</strong> for the business requirements, which also needed automated <strong>periodic backups</strong>. <strong>Networking and VPN</strong> related configurations as well as <strong>DNS</strong> configurations were also required. <strong>Monitoring</strong> tools had to be configured so we can get alerts in case things were about to fail. <strong>Deployment scripts</strong> had to be written for this service as well.</p><blockquote><p>All in all, I&rsquo;d say <strong>it took 20x the time to deploy this microservice than writing the code for it</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>Really. No kidding.</p><p>Since it has been deployed, we didn&rsquo;t ship changes as often to this service compared to our main project. This is what I find to be the primary benefit of this approach, since it doesn&rsquo;t require as big a regression test during our releases.</p><p>However, when things go wrong, our debug efforts are harder since more infrastructural pieces are involved. Considering the additional work required and the value gain, I&rsquo;m really not sure if microservices provide any real ROI.</p><p>The additional complexity of dealing with many servers as opposed to a larger app may or may not be worth it. I agree with Martin Fowler on the <a href=http://martinfowler.com/bliki/MicroservicePrerequisites.html>prerequisites of microservices</a>. Unless, you have streamlined an automated way to provision new servers with all required parts, it may actually be best for you to keep working on the monolith. It&rsquo;s not the end of the world, and you&rsquo;ll have more time to spend with the family!</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-navy bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://smsohan.com/>&copy; Sohan's Blog 2024</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
