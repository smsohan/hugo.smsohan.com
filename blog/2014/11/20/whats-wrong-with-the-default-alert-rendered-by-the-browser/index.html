</code></pre><p>While writing cross-browser JavaScript is not as painful today, custom implementation of these natively supported dialogs seem to be a <strong>complete waste</strong> of money and time to me. With all the different browsers that we have to support today, including the mobile browsers, it seems a lot of wasted effort in trying to render a custom alert and confirm dialog under any circumstance. I&rsquo;ve never implemented one, but if you ever attempted, you probably know how much work it is to get it right and consistent. Here&rsquo;s a short list of requirements if you want to build one:</p><ol><li>Should work on all browsers.</li><li>Needs to disable all other controls on the website.</li><li>Needs to be on the view port so the user can take an action immediately.</li><li>Should not leak any memory if used repeatedly on a single screen.</li><li>Should be fast.</li></ol><p>While I&rsquo;ve seen some magicians to make these requirements look silly and do a decent job of implementing a custom version of the alert and confirm dialogs, I&rsquo;m yet to see one that satisfies all the above essential requirements, and does a better job than the browser&rsquo;s native implementations. If you haven&rsquo;t looked recently, see the current rendering of the confirm dialogs across different browsers:</p><p><img src=/images/safari_confirm.png alt=Safari>
<img src=/images/chrome_confirm.png alt=Chrome>
<img src=/images/firefox_confirm.png alt=FireFox>
<img src=/images/iphone_confirm.png alt=iPhone></p><p>If you look carefully, you&rsquo;ll see subtle things. For example, did you notice the <strong>nice shadows</strong> around the confirm dialogs rendered on Chrome and Safari? There are live effects on the cancel and ok buttons as well, where you&rsquo;ll see a little <strong>shining effect</strong> on the ok button. These are carefully crafted buttons. The Cancel and OK button are perfectly sized for <strong>fat fingers</strong> on the iOS safari. Also, these are <strong>familiar</strong> to the users, so they immediately know what they are clicking on. <strong>Keyboard navigation</strong> works as expected. And lastly. the buttons will change labels based on your <strong>preferred language</strong> settings. All for <strong>free</strong>. Now, try to replicate that on your custom control, across all these browsers and show me how it does any better.</p><p>If your sole business is indeed building these custom dialogs, you can probably invest the time and money here. But as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, I&rsquo;d not put a single $ from my pocket if I was funding a project to either build such custom implementations or using your custom implementation. I&rsquo;m aware of the fact that, even if it&rsquo;s free and open source, it still requires additional maintenance dollars.</p><p>As a user of web, I&rsquo;ve never been bothered by the websites that show me these familiar browser rendered alerts and confirms. Were you?</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-navy bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://smsohan.com/>&copy; Sohan's Blog 2023</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
