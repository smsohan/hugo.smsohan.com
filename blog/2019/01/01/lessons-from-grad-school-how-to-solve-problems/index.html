Most problems are solved inefficiently. Innovation follows when a problem is researched first.
I spent a fair amount of time in grad school. First, sixteen months on my MSc, and then another forty eight months on my PhD program. Also, I worked as a pro software engineer for 20 hours/week during my MSc days and then full-time during the PhD days. It was quite an undertaking, but I survived and now claiming my bragging rights :-)"><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.109.0"><meta name=robots content="noindex, nofollow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.css><meta property="og:title" content="What I Learned from Grad School about Innovation?"><meta property="og:description" content="Src: Claudia Dea

First, sixteen months on my MSc, and then another forty eight months on my PhD program. Also, I worked as a pro software engineer for 20 hours/week during my MSc days and then full-time during the PhD days. It was quite an undertaking, but I survived and now claiming my bragging rights :-)</p><p>This post is about a general problem-solving approach that I internalized as the most valuable lesson from my grad school days. I hope you find it useful.
I&rsquo;ll try and explain the concept using a personal story. Here you go.</p><p>Recently, I was discussing plans for the near future with my wife, Shahana. She&rsquo;s an engineer. In the past, Shahana worked in the telecom industry as a network planner for a few years. Then, she decided to take an extended maternity leave to stay with our two little kids, Shopoth and Shera. Now, honestly, she&rsquo;s had enough and seriously contemplating a return to work. Except, she&rsquo;s unsure about what career to choose that she&rsquo;d really enjoy.</p><p>Given this vague problem of finding a new career, she felt lost for a while. As a true supportive husband, I decided to be her man and gave her an earful!</p><p>Silly jokes apart, we decided to set the <strong>context</strong> first by asking and answering the following questions:</p><ol><li><strong>Why</strong> is she looking for a new career?</li><li><strong>Why not</strong> remain in the old career?</li><li><strong>What</strong> new career options exist?</li><li><strong>Where</strong> are the opportunities?</li><li><strong>Who</strong> knows more about those?</li><li><strong>How</strong> does she get a job in the preferred area?</li></ol><p>After spending a few days of research, she developed a very clear <strong>understanding of the problem</strong> and the initial vagueness of the situation was mostly wiped clean resulting in a few clear <strong>constraints</strong>. From a job portal, Shahana then <strong>listed available</strong> job requirements from a number of open positions matching her criteria. After consolidation of the requirements, the <strong>gap</strong> was clear. It was obvious that she&rsquo;d need to <strong>develop essential new</strong> skills to qualify for the jobs. As she acquires the new skills, she already knows the <strong>evaluation</strong>. If this doesn&rsquo;t work, she can <strong>repeat</strong> the same process to either <strong>improve</strong> her chances or choose an <strong>alternate</strong> career path entirely.</p><p>This was a direct application of the problem-solving framework that I learned from grad school. Here&rsquo;s a nerdy version of the framework:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>  Given a problem
    1. Ask the Wh questions -&gt; list constraints
    2. Research -&gt; list existing solutions
    3. Is the problem already solved? -&gt; If yes, stop
    4. Innovate, fill in the gaps.
    5. Evaluate
</code></pre><p>In real life, most problems are deceptive. We think we already know the best solution based on our past experience and go straight to #4 leaving all other parts out. Even if going straight to #4 is actually a wise move, it only becomes an innovation with a tiny impact, as it doesn&rsquo;t become available at step 3 for others to leverage.</p><p>A large number of problems can be solved at step 3, by leveraging a solution or a mix of multiple solutions that already exist. Even when problems get past step 3, it&rsquo;s highly likely that the gap is smaller than the extent of the whole problem. So, an innovation can focus only on solving the gap, which offers speed and intelligent reuse.</p><p>This post is so prosaic already. But if you&rsquo;re still with me, I&rsquo;ll make it even more textbook like by giving you a couple of practice problems. Go ahead and apply my 5-step problem solving approach:</p><ol><li>Jane is a musician, a prodigy so to speak. She&rsquo;s been invited to talk about music as a therapy. She&rsquo;s not good at speaking, but this is a big opportunity. What does she do?</li><li>Mike is a young startup CEO. He&rsquo;s very good at business and technology. He needs a lawyer to take care of the legal matters. How does he hire the best lawyer possible?</li></ol><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-navy bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://smsohan.com/>&copy; Sohan's Blog 2023</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
