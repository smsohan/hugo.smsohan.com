After <a href=/blog/2019/06/05/polyglot-yyc-2019-my-first-unconference/>Polyglot YYC</a>, this was the second conference I joined this year. This was a 50/50 event for me in terms of like vs. dislike. Here goes my notes:</p><p>Ix-Chel Ruiz presented the keynote to start the day. Her storytelling style reminded me of WWII movies, where a lot of cloudy and gloomy scene keep getting darker and darker, ending with a deep sense of sadness. Ix-Chel used quotes from the likes of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Galloway_(professor)>Prof. Galloway</a> and Elon Musk to tell a story about how the modern tech is creeping into our private lives. I wish she had prepared for the keynote a little better. She paced it so slowly yet ran out of the material half-way through the slot. In a way I liked the early finish because I just wanted to feel optimistic about the future.</p><p>The stunning view of Banff landscape brightened up the mood a bit:</p><p><img src=/images/banff.jpg alt=banff></p><p>There were 4 other talks on the same day and I liked the talk on <a href=https://vuejs.org>Vue.js</a> and <a href=https://vuetifyjs.com/en/>Vuetify</a> by <a href=https://www.davepaquette.com>Dave Paquette</a>. Since, I use VueJS at work, it was easier to relate to. Dave showed us how he&rsquo;s using Vue.js to render a real-time collaborative UI for complex seating requirements at <a href=https://www.flyovercanada.com>FlyOver Canada</a>.</p><p>Among other talks, there was one on data management for machine learning and another one on Kotlin, I liked these talks but didn&rsquo;t fully relate with the topics.</p><p>There was a talk on using Kafka for geo-fencing applications. The presenter could&rsquo;ve spent more time on the parts of kafka that makes it a compelling case for using in geo-fencing applications. Instead, he delved into the code, java, and jar files.</p><p>There was another talk on using <a href=https://eventstore.org>EventStore</a> for event sourcing. The presenters set the story saying that they had an opportunity to try new technologies while rewriting a &ldquo;monolithic&rdquo; application and they used EventStore with &ldquo;multi-services&rdquo; to implement it so it&rsquo;s easier to evolve the system. I&rsquo;d love to see some evidence of the desired outcome, that&rsquo;d be motivating. But in the end it was about the &ldquo;how&rdquo; instead of the &ldquo;why&rdquo;.</p><p>One thing to note is, even for talks that could be more engaging, I still learned quite a few new things.</p><p>Beyond the talks, I like going to conferences as it opens the opportunity to meet new people and some known faces. In hindsight, had I known about this event before the talks were finalized, we&rsquo;d have submitted a few proposals from Cisco. Looking forward to the next round for an opportunity to share some innovative work we&rsquo;re doing at Cisco.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-navy bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://smsohan.com/>&copy; Sohan's Blog 2023</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
