When we work together, let&rsquo;s do this:</p><p><strong>Trust</strong> is only earned when it&rsquo;s mutual. Let&rsquo;s work with this shared belief.</p><p><strong>Context</strong> is everything. Most importantly, show me <strong>why</strong> we need to work on something. If the answer isn&rsquo;t clear in your mind, we can work together to build a crisp context.</p><p><strong>Solutions</strong> for problems you&rsquo;re raising. Ideally, you&rsquo;ve already thought about a few solutions with some measure of feasibility for each, and you come with an open mind. I know you care about the problem only if you spent some time thinking about a few solutions.</p><p><strong>Clarity</strong> between your evidence and assumptions. Assumptions are often essential to move ahead, but treating assumptions as evidence can be harmful.</p><p><strong>Output</strong> is the focus, our egos aren&rsquo;t. That said, let&rsquo;s be mutually respectful.</p><p><strong>Time</strong> is managed. Let&rsquo;s manage our expectations given the time we have. Blaming the shortage of time shows a lack of skill.</p><p><strong>Writing</strong> is a great thought exercise and good write-up scales infinitely. Let&rsquo;s write and rewrite our thoughts, specially when we&rsquo;re unclear about those.</p><p><strong>Standup comedies, biography, soccer, politics, investment, tech, leadership, Netflix, movies, and similar topics</strong> are cool. Sorry, not much of a Hockey or Basket Ball fan. Mostly a passive music listener and happy to listen whatever is on radio or a YouTube playlist.</p><p>If you have a similar list, I&rsquo;d be happy to read and respect it. Please send along.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-navy bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://smsohan.com/>&copy; Sohan's Blog 2023</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
