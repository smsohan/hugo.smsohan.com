To achieve those goals, we often have to introduce a change. For example, we may want to change how a team is formed or what product a team works on based on new business needs or opportunities. So, we put a lot of thought into it and propose our plan to the team hoping the following reaction:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-javascript data-lang=javascript><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#a6e22e>$</span>(<span style=color:#a6e22e>team</span>).<span style=color:#a6e22e>on</span>(<span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;change&#34;</span>, <span style=color:#a6e22e>excitement</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Before proposing such a change, we&rsquo;ve analyzed various options, including the option of keeping everything as-is. We&rsquo;re fully convinced that indeed the change we&rsquo;re going to propose is the best option. We are excited with this new way that&rsquo;ll make our teams more productive. As caring managers, we are thrilled because we believe this will make the team happier.</p><h2 id=teams-mind>Team&rsquo;s Mind</h2><p>However, most of the team&rsquo;s reaction is as follows:</p><div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-javascript data-lang=javascript><span style=display:flex><span><span style=color:#a6e22e>$</span>(<span style=color:#a6e22e>team</span>).<span style=color:#a6e22e>on</span>(<span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;change&#34;</span>, <span style=color:#a6e22e>panic</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Honestly, the team has a great chemistry going on, they have fun and work well together, they are already so productive shipping products using technology they use today. So, at best a change seems random, but more commonly perceived as a mindless act of &ldquo;management BS&rdquo;.</p><h2 id=the-deadlock>The Deadlock</h2><p>At this stage, both the manager and the team are in a deadlock, each party fairly confident in their judgement, failing to appreciate the concerns of the other. At this point, it&rsquo;s the manager&rsquo;s job to not only break the deadlock but also to make sure s/he carefully listens to the team and motivates them. Ideally, we can data-drive these conversations while being mindful of individual emotions.</p><h2 id=the-checklist>The Checklist</h2><p>Here&rsquo;s a checklist I&rsquo;m following myself as a manager as I&rsquo;m trying to orient my teams from technology driven teams to more full-stack product mission oriented teams:</p><ol><li>Motivate the team with a why. <em>e.g. Go from tech-oriented teams to product mission teams so that all of you can deliver products to customers&mldr;</em></li><li>Listen to the team. Multiple one on one sessions if needed. <em>e.g. Let&rsquo;s discuss about your concerns regarding tech debt with this change&mldr;</em></li><li>Discuss changes to your plan based on the team&rsquo;s feedback. <em>e.g. You&rsquo;ll have full ownership of the technology to serve your mission&mldr;</em></li><li>Layout your evidence. <em>e.g. We built an improved search feature that we couldn&rsquo;t ship to customers for months because the UI team was busy&mldr;</em></li><li>Discuss pros and cons of alternatives you thought about. <em>e.g. Another option is to keep as-is, but that&rsquo;d mean we must improve cross-team project management to reduce hand-off related delays&mldr;</em></li><li>Present your metrics to achieve. <em>e.g. Time from dev to customer, performance metrics,&mldr;</em></li><li>Present an iterative and incremental plan with the option to change course based on metrics. <em>e.g. Let&rsquo;s do this with one team for one month&mldr;</em></li></ol><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-navy bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://smsohan.com/>&copy; Sohan's Blog 2024</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
