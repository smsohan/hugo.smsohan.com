This was the first time I was interviewing for an engineering manager role. Soon I realized these interviews were wildly different from interviews for developer roles. During typical developer interviews, I solved coding and system design problems and discussed personal aspirations in behavioral interviews. In contrast, leadership interview qeustions were really open-ended. Honestly, I found it very hard to answer these questions concisely. Often I could form a crisp answer to these questions only after the interview had finished :-( Here are some example questions:</p><ol><li>What is your management philosophy?</li><li>Tell me when you had to deal with uncertainty.</li><li>Tell me about when you had to motivate a team even though you personally disagreed with the project.</li><li>Tell me when you innovated as a manager.</li></ol><p>I did poorly in my first few interviews because how unprepared I was to answer these questions. I got truly frustrated. So, I started looking at YouTube to see how today&rsquo;s inspiring leaders answer these questions. Here&rsquo;s a list of YouTube channels that I found to be very resourceful.</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/DavidRubenstein/videos?view=0&sort=p&shelf_id=8">David Rubnstein Show</a>: 25 minute very high quality interviews with present and former leaders in business and technology.</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxq_lXOUlvQAwaY_9K4ZFH9Xdar9WzCaL">View From the Top - Stanford</a>: Hour long interview sessions with renowned leaders.</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnsTB8Q5VgnVzh1S-VMCXiuwJglk5AV--">Technology Enabled Blitzscaling</a>: Hour long interview sessions focusing on technology and startup leadership.</li></ol><p>Watching these videos I developed some strategies for concisely answering leadership related questions with authenticity. I&rsquo;d so love to do a formal research and write up on this topic some time. But for now, here&rsquo;s the raw data for your enjoyment.</p><p>Go ahead and watch!</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-navy bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://smsohan.com/>&copy; Sohan's Blog 2023</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
