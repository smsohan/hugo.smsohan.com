Let&rsquo;s focus on rationale behind MongoDB&rsquo;s architectural decisions. You can find answers to all of the following questions
if you went through the guide or the video. But my goal is get you to think about the why behind the decisions.</p><p>MongoDB has databases and collections. While collections are conceptually parallel to tables in traditional relational databases, MongoDB doesn&rsquo;t impose
any restrictions on the schema of a collection. Can you think of reasons behind this decision? What trade-offs come to your mind? For example,
not having a schema allows you to store anything within a collection, essentially reducing the need for schema migrations on very large databases.
But at the same time, it may complicate consumption of the data. What other trade-offs can you think of?</p><p>MongoDB uses a router named Mongos and needs config servers to route queries when data is sharded into multiple partitions. What benefits and challenges do you see with the addition of this router component?</p><p>MongoDB requires you to have an uneven number of replicas to deal with failover when a new primary node needs to be elected. How do you judge this design decision?</p><p>By design, MongoDB allows you to choose a write concern at write time to allow you to balance your need in the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem>CAP</a> triangle. Can you explain what you must do
to ensure you&rsquo;ll not lose data is 2 out of 3 of your replica servers were to go corrupt?</p><p>MongoDB allows you to run complex map-reduce queries in the form of aggregate pipelines. In a distributed database, which component within the MongoDB ecosystem
is responsible for aggregating data that spans multiple nodes?</p><p>If you followed the Redis post, what would you say are the top 3 architectural differences between MongoDB and Redis? Can you reason about the why behind the
differences?</p><p>Based on MongoDB&rsquo;s architecture, where do you see a potential bottleneck that can affect scaling a MongoDB cluster? What can you do to workaround the limitations?</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-navy bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://smsohan.com/>&copy; Sohan's Blog 2023</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
