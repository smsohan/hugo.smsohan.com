Back then, on Friday, May 26, 2006, I was a final year undergrad student at CSE, BUET. I was looking for a part-time software dev job opportunity and found a little one page advert for a student job at asha-technologies (lately renamed as Code71). Visited their website and thought it might be worth giving a try!
As usual, I was interviewed over phone and enjoyed a long 2 hour interview on premise.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/2009/07/16/rails-modeling-guide1-right-structure/ class="link black dim">Rails modeling guide#1: right structure of a ruby on rails model</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Rails models are no exception compared to the super models!

At Code71, we are keeping our rails models attractive following a few guidelines. I will be posting these guidelines in a series and here goes the first one - about the physical structure of the ruby on rails models.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/2009/07/16/rails-modeling-guide2-naming-ruby-on/ class="link black dim">Rails modeling guide#2: naming convention for ruby on rails model methods</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Naming conventions play an important role to the software's overall architecture. It is not a rocket science, still, it may lead to unhappy consequences if not taken care of at the early stage of a project. This small best practices can make a code base significantly improved.
Rails does a good job by using the dynamic power of ruby and providing with a handful of dynamic methods with the models.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/2009/07/07/implementing-breadcrumb-in-rails/ class="link black dim">Implementing breadcrumb in rails projects – a clean approach</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">In most web applications, breadcrumbs offer a nice way to trace back to previously visited pages. However, generating the breadcrumbs and showing them on dynamic pages sometimes need special care for the following reasons-
The links of the breadcrumb may contain dynamic links. It is used in all the pages. So, changing the breadcrumb may trigger a series of changes. In ScrumPad, we are using ruby on rails. There are a few plugins to help rails projects in managing breadcrumbs, but none seemed to satisfy our need.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/2009/06/15/2009-06-15-lesson2-pace-your-sprint-rightly/ class="link black dim">Lesson#2: Pace Your Sprint Rightly</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">In my previous post, I said about being incremental.

So, once you decided to take small increments, make sure you reach the targets sprinting.
I suggest you prepare for sprinting with the right techniques and tools. A few recommendations-
Never miss a daily standup meeting. Spend only 2 minutes (or less) per person answering the three questions – what did you do yesterday, what’s on the plate for today and what is blocking the race?</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/2009/06/15/lesson2-pace-your-sprint-rightly/ class="link black dim">Lesson#2: Pace Your Sprint Rightly</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">In my previous post, I said about being incremental.

Take a small piece at a time and sprint. I took this image from internet and credits to this site.
It’s easy to work out the Natural way than to defy it! If you are iterative and incremental, you are reaching towards the right hand side of the image! And to make the evolution faster, I suggest you try out Scrumming with ScrumPad.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/2009/05/13/unit-test-actioncontroller-filters/ class="link black dim">Unit/Functional Test Rails ActionController filters following DRY</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">At ScrumPad most of our controllers are bounded by filters for authentication/authorization. Some filters apply to all actions in a controller while others apply to only a few or leave out only a few. However, since we are following TDD, we need to test the filter is invoked before each of the desired action. This makes the test code MOIST (not DRY)!
Example of Moist Code:

StoryCompleteError
StoryNotFoundError
StoryDeleteError
StoryDeleteNotAllowedErrorThese exceptions are really useful in my application. But the bad thing is, they all derive from StandardError class, whereas there should be a base class, may be StoryError, which is more meaningful and useful.
