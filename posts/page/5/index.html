Most problems are solved inefficiently. Innovation follows when a problem is researched first.
I spent a fair amount of time in grad school. First, sixteen months on my MSc, and then another forty eight months on my PhD program. Also, I worked as a pro software engineer for 20 hours/week during my MSc days and then full-time during the PhD days. It was quite an undertaking, but I survived and now claiming my bragging rights :-)</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/2018/10/10/headless-ci/ class="link black dim">Headless CI</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Past few months at work we&rsquo;re trying to revamp our CI infra.

Family, friends, and colleagues are all sending their wishes, and it feels great to have crossed this milestone.
To be honest, deep inside, I carry a sad and guilty feeling, which at times overshadows the feeling of acomplishment. This phenomenon is hard to write about, but I wanted to give it a try anyway.
So, it was 2012. Life was good. I got promoted to Senior Consultant at ThoughtWorks and Shahana got a job almost immediately following the completion of her grad school.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/2017/09/07/on-reference-checks-donts/ class="link black dim">On Reference Checks: Don'ts</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Most people eventually come across a time when they&rsquo;d need to provide names of colleagues as references while applying for a new job. The referees are often involved in the last stage of the hiring process, when the employer is generally satisfied that the candidate is a potential hire. At this stage, the employer expects to find a few things:
Verification of facts. The employer wants to confirm the validity of the information such as the role, responsibilities, and achievements provided by the candidate about their past experience.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/2017/02/28/so-you-want-to-be-a-software-developer-where-to-start/ class="link black dim">So you want to be a software developer.

First, you&rsquo;re thinking in the right direction, and I can assure you that if you like making things and have a nack for problem-solving, you can learn the skills to become a programmer.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/2017/02/27/why-do-you-want-this-new-job/ class="link black dim">Why do you want this new job?</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">No matter which side of the table you&rsquo;ve sat during interviews, you&rsquo;ve probably heard this question: &lsquo;Why do you want this new job?&rsquo;

I&rsquo;m not learning much on the current job after it&rsquo;s been 2-4 years. I&rsquo;m looking for something that offers better work-life balance. I&rsquo;m not really looking for a job.

And I got to say hi to people like @dhh, @wycats, and many more. Thanks Cisco for sponsoring this trip.
The attendance on the conference was totally amazing, heaven knows how many, but it looked like a couple thousands of rails developers attended the @dhh keynote. And @dhh delivered a good one. Unlike the last year&rsquo;s talk, this year it didn&rsquo;t cause a huge noise because it was mostly about announcing new features of rails to be released with Rails 5.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/2015/03/23/rails-please-include-a-js-test-runner/ class="link black dim">Rails: Please include a JS test runner</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">For an opinionated framework like Ruby on Rails, I expect it to come pre-bundled with a CoffeeScript based test framework and test runner.

Teams don&rsquo;t need to waste time deciding which one to use among the mess of Jasmine, Mocha, Expect, Sinon, Chai, Bower, Grunt, Teaspoon, Npm&mldr; you name it.
It&rsquo;d work better than what&rsquo;s out there since the Rails team will focus on clean integration with Rails and will have a much larger user base to collect contribution from.</div></div></div></div></section><ul class="pagination pagination-default"><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/ aria-label=First class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/4/ aria-label=Previous class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/3/ aria-label="Page 3" class=page-link role=button>3</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/4/ aria-label="Page 4" class=page-link role=button>4</a></li><li class="page-item active"><a aria-current=page aria-label="Page 5" class=page-link role=button>5</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/6/ aria-label="Page 6" class=page-link role=button>6</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/7/ aria-label="Page 7" class=page-link role=button>7</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/6/ aria-label=Next class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/25/ aria-label=Last class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;&#187;</span></a></li></ul></article></main><footer class="bg-navy bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://smsohan.com/>&copy; Sohan's Blog 2023</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
