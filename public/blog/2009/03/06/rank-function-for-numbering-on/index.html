I need to produce, the top 5 trims for a Year, Make, Model combination that yields maximum profits.</p><p>So, to solve this problem, I cannot simply use ROW_NUMBER(). Basically, I need to find the row numbers starting from 1 for each group of Year, Make and Model. Then, take only those rows having a rank &lt;= 5. Ranking based on such groups/partitions can be easily done by using the RANK() function. I am quoting the syntax <a href=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms176102.aspx target=_blank>from MSDN</a> here-</p><pre>RANK ( )    OVER ( [ &lt; partition_by_clause &gt; ] &lt; order_by_clause &gt; )</pre><br><p>So, in my case the query is something like the following-</p><br><p>RANK ( ) OVER ( <strong>PARTITION BY</strong> Year, MAKE, MODEL <strong>ORDER BY</strong> Profit DESC, Trim )</p><br><p>So, the RANK() is similar to ROW_NUMBER() in the context of the PARTITION. As if, the RANK() restarts counting from 1 for each partition. I think, like me, many of you may find it new and useful in similar requirements.</p><br><p>Without using this function, it will be much difficult to produce the desired result set. However, if you have a nicer/alternative solution, please teach me!</p></div><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-navy bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://smsohan.com/>&copy; Sohan's Blog 2023</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
