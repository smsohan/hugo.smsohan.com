At times I wanted to push some files with my blog so that people can download and check something locally. Up until now, it was not a straight-forward way. I either uploaded the file to my own server or google pages or somewhere. Then linked it on the blog.<br />However, you can now publish files from <a href="http://skydrive.live.com/">Windows Live SkyDrive</a>&nbsp;(total free space of 25 GB)&nbsp;or <a href="http://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a> (Total free space 1GB). If you haven't checked already, google now offers you the opportunity to upload any kind of file without conversion. I know there are other services like this, but these two should be reliable.<br />I took some information from this <a href="http://www.itwriting.com/blog/2082-store-any-type-of-file-in-google-apps-in-effect-gdrive.html">Tim Anderson's ITWriting blog</a>.</div>
