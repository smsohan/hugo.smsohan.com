Rails isn't a framework. Ruby on Rails is. So it is not Ruby (language) on Rails (framework). Rails are those things that trains moves on. So Ruby on Rails means (at least for me) something like "accelerated ruby with a lot of constrains". And this is a name of a framework. Rails on Ruby would be something like: "this poor guy Ruby takes those heavy rails on his shoulders and walks in pain with it"</div></div></div><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-navy bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://smsohan.com/>&copy; Sohan's Blog 2023</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
