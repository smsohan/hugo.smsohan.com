They are about to launch their product for the first release and wanted to ensure they have the most obvious things checked. So, in a sense it was not supposed to be a hacking job for me, rather to check if the most well known security measures are in place. This is what I looked into so far:<br /><br /><ol><li><b>Password:</b> Password was encrypted using a salt. However, the default logger would log the password as they didn't use the <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">filter_paramerer_logging</span> method.</li><li><b>Cross-Site Scripting</b><b>: </b>I was able to easily inject a script by just entering &lt;script&gt;alert('Script')&lt;/script&gt; when I signed up to the system and every time it would open an alert window whenever I navigated to a new page! So, I recommended them to use &lt;%= h %&gt;. However, Rails 3 does a good job of making this a default.</li><li><b>Authorization: </b>I found the weakest measure in the implementation of Authorization. For an example, there is a calendar in the web app where one can add/remove events. I found that any logged in user, not necessarily the event owner, could change/remove any calendar event. This was a shocker. Next, I found this same thing happening to the core models as well. The catch here is, they had a filter that checked if a user was logged in, but they didn't check if a user has rights to modify an instance of the object. For example, there is a project model, that can only be modified by the project owner. However, this per object ownership was not authorized and it was a huge potential security bug in my opinion.</li><li><b>File uploads: </b>The app was designed to upload the files to a folder underneath the <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">public</span> folder. Which means, if the rails server was down, apache would serve the files directly to the user bypassing whatever security measure was taken inside the app.</li><li><b>PRG violation: </b>This is a good idea to follow a post-redirect-get pattern when an object is modified through <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">post/delete/put</span> to ensure pressing the browser refresh button doesn't re-invoke the change. This wasn't done at some places which might end in multiple payments and such severe risks.</li><li><b>Direct public release: </b>I was a bit concerned that they wanted to go public release with their first ever release, even before having an alpha or at least in-house user. This is important because this application deals with money and credit cards. Trust is very important for such apps. So, I advised them to try this for some real works at home other than the <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">"asdf asdf asdf...."(!)</span>&nbsp;kind inputs. This will help them spotting some of the odd behaviors early and cause less embarrassment.</li></ol><div>It was only a 4 hour assignment for me. Also, I was only limited to the source code and the test deployment that they have now. However, it seemed to me that, they might spend a few hours to fix the obvious errors and do some in-house real use before going to a public release.</div><div><br /></div></div>
