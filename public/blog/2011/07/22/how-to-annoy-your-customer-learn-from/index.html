The account status email is one step ahead in that same direction.<br><br>This is how it starts:<br><br>At the top right corner, it says July 2011, in grayed out font! A deliberate attempt to de-emphasize the statement period!<br><br>Just below the date, there is a fake input box and a button labeled Go. This is an image and if you click it, it will actually open a new page instead of asking for user input right inside the search box. This is just following the theory of most surprise (as opposed to <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment>principle of least surprise</a>)!<br><br>Next, in red background, they welcome me by saying, Welcome, S. M. Sohan! Customer Number: ### wtf? Customer Number? Do I give a shit what my customer number is? Why is the welcome grouped together with search and contact? How are these related?<br><br>Then it says, Log in to your account on <b>our secure website</b> to view <b>your most recent account</b> statement. What does this mean? Does it mean, this statement is not recent? Is this not secure?<br><br>Then it says, Summary of your account as of 7/21/2011<b>**</b>. That f'ing footnote will tell you that, the information may not reflect recent changes! What? Is this good enough till 7/21? If not, why do you even send this bullshit to me?<br><br>Then it has 4 boxes side by side. The first one, <b>Messages</b> has Alerts: No, Notification(s): Yes. <b>View now</b> is a button to their site. How stupid is this? Why bother saying alerts "No"? If you know I have notifications, why not put it right here? Why are you confused about notification"(s)" - you should know if its just one (notification) or more (notifications). How lazy is that?<br><br>Items Expiring is the other funny one. It says, Domain names: No. Then it says renew now. What? You're saying nothing is expiring. Why on earth I would renew something?<br><br>Then it takes almost 50% of the screen for asking me to contact with them through a number of channels including Facebook. Really? Facebook fan of GoDaddy? Crazy people!<br><br>In the end, they don't care putting a note of thanks, let alone personalize it with the name of an actual person. Isn't it rude to end an email this way?<br><br>Now, with all these hammerings - as if it fell short of creating enough fun, it says, More for You: followed by tens of fine print links to things that don't matter at all to me. Oh boy! you are awesome!<br><br>I am not a designer by any means. However, I think, even I can design a better version than this crap. Here's my version in a screen mockup.<br><br><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center></div><div class=separator style=clear:both;text-align:center><a href=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-T-ySiJT4c-s/TinOUi2YfRI/AAAAAAAAAV0/zXKeZxR2wIM/s1600/Screenshot-2.png imageanchor=1 style=margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em><img border=0 height=330 src=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-T-ySiJT4c-s/TinOUi2YfRI/AAAAAAAAAV0/zXKeZxR2wIM/s400/Screenshot-2.png width=400></a></div><br><br><br><br><br></div></div><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-navy bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://smsohan.com/>&copy; Sohan's Blog 2023</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
