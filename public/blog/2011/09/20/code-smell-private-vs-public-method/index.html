In my opinion, we use private methods to:
1. &nbsp;isolate a block of code to be reused inside the class.
2. &nbsp;extract code from another method for code readability.
Now, taking these two use cases in mind, here's an easy conclusion:"><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.108.0"><meta name=robots content="noindex, nofollow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.css><meta property="og:title" content="Excess of Private Methods is a Code Smell"><meta property="og:description" content="Private methods, when used meaningfully, are a great tool for writing beautiful object oriented code.

Here's a code example from the Play! framework, an MVC franework for Java developers.<br><br><a href=https://github.com/playframework/play/blob/925a0676148f6cb149350f899a60d934544ab61a/framework/src/play/mvc/ActionInvoker.java>ActionInvoker.java</a><br><br>You will see there are public methods with 100+ lines. I hope you agree with me:<br><blockquote>"The ActionInvoker.java code is not readable"</blockquote>For the sake of readability, introducing private methods with good names would help. However, that doesn't eliminate any of&nbsp;the possible code paths from the public methods. So, if you are lucky, you will see really long unit tests with complex setup conditions and mock expectations. Otherwise, there will be no tests at all! Without any tests for such long and complex methods, use them at your own risk. I won't :(<br><br><span class=Apple-style-span style=color:#666>Disclaimer: I like the play! framework a lot.
