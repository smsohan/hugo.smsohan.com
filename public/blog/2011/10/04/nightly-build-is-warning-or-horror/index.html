I think, Nightly build is an anti-pattern for Continuous Integration. If you are integrating continuously, then you shouldn't need a nightly build, that would be too discrete :(
If you already have a per-commit continuous integration setup, you shouldn't need the so called nightly build unless there's something bad about the code.
Often times, builds taking >10 minutes are put in the bucket of nightly builds.
Some people put batch processing related tests under such nightly builds."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.108.0"><meta name=robots content="noindex, nofollow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.css><meta property="og:title" content="Nightly Build is a Warning (or Horror)"><meta property="og:description" content="Photo credits:&nbsp;insidethemagic

A colleague told me they used nightly build to clean up resources (disk space, recreate the database etc.) on a nightly build - to ensure the apps worked fine on a fresh state.<br><blockquote>Under most circumstances, a nighly build means something long running. That in itself can be an indication of poor performance.</blockquote>But what I have seen is, when such nightly builds are broken - they are rarely looked after or cared for. Because, first thing in the morning, who the hell wants to look at that broken nightly build? Even if someone takes a look, since its long running, it might well eat up all morning to actually try/fix/commit changes and see it go green again! Since it takes longer to make the build green, people keep delaying it for later... meaning<br><blockquote>it becomes generally acceptable to let the nightly build stay in RED.&nbsp;</blockquote>And once people get used the redness of the nightly build, they start ignoring it, inevitably.<br><br>So, here's what I would do:<br><blockquote>Avoid nightly builds altogether.<br>Avoid nightly builds altogether.<br>Avoid nightly builds altogether.<br>Otherwise, make one person from the team responsible for the build (rotate people).</blockquote><div><br></div></div></div><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-navy bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://smsohan.com/>&copy; Sohan's Blog 2023</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
