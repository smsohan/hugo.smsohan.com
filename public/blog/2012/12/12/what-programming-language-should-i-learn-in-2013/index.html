This is also mentioned at <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer">The Pragmatic Programmer Book</a>. I&rsquo;m now looking for a new language to learn.</p>
<p>In 2011, I learned <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/fsharp/">F#</a>, my first functional programming language experience. It&rsquo;s a really nice language, especially if you&rsquo;re familiar with the .Net class library and the windows development echo system in general. This was really fun, learned the basic concepts and building blocks of functional languages.</p>
<p>The direct impact of F# is, even if I&rsquo;m not using F#, I&rsquo;m consciously using the concepts in other languages. For example, Ruby comes with a handful of functional style methods in its <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Array.html">Array/Enumerable API</a>, and so does UnderscoreJS. Not just that, I&rsquo;m always watching for opporunities to reduce side-effects, use delayed execution and pass around blocks when it makes sense. Learning F# has improved my Ruby/JavaScript/C# coding as a direct result. One disclaimer here, I&rsquo;ve failed to grasp the true concepts of <a href="%22http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(category_theory)%22">Category Theory and Monads</a>, although I understand how to use these.</p>
<p>I also learned ObjectiveC in 2011 while working on a project with ThoughtWorks. This was fun, apart from the frustrations with the IDE. As a language, I actually liked it quite a lot, the way they handle dynamic message passing while still giving you compile errors looked really innovative to me. I believe there&rsquo;s a lot of room for me to learn more about ObjectiveC and Cocoa framework in general. Please let me know if there&rsquo;s a good open source project where I can see professional level ObjectiveC code.</p>
<p>2012 was my year of learning JavaScript. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I&rsquo;ve been writing JavaScript for some time now, but I think I really learned the language in 2012. Thanks to the influx of micro libraries, as well as their coolness, and seriousness. CoffeeScript made me immensely happy, too. Started writing a JavaScript book with <a href="http://isagoksu.com/">Isa Goksu</a>, too bad we didn&rsquo;t get far with it :(</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m yet to pick a new language for 2013. Any suggestion? Or, what are you learning in 2013?</p>
