<blockquote>
<p>Should I call you S M?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m from Bangladesh and even today, we don&rsquo;t really have a first and last name, instead what we have is, a full name and a nick name. My <strong>full name</strong> is, S M Sohan, and my <strong>nick name</strong> is Sohan. So, call me Sohan.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a first or last name like many people in Bangladesh. But since almost everywhere, from the online forms to the call center agents, they ask me about these info, I tell them, my first name is, S M, and last name is, Sohan. At times I get funny reactions to this, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>S M? Just S M?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Better yet, some offer me spelling suggestions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can spell it ESEM, because SM is hard to pronounce!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You people are funny! Well, S M is actually a short form for <strong>Sheikh Mohammed</strong>. But it&rsquo;s so common in Bangladesh that, almost nobody uses the full version in their official documents. As a bonus, you save all those inks and bytes required to spell these extra characters. Honestly, of all these years, this is probably just the 4th time I&rsquo;ve written the full form, the other 3 times were for US visa applications. Also, it&rsquo;d be equally weird to me, had I used Sheikh as my first name and people called me by that!</p>
<p>This first/last name convention also causes funny consequences to my friends. For example, two of my friends have names differing only in their middle names and they were rommies at a shared residence in Calgary. Guess what, their credit reports got all confused about who&rsquo;s who and mixed up the scores!</p>
<p>Lot of my muslim friends go by &ldquo;Md Xxxx Yyyy&rdquo;, where Md is a short form for Mohammed. People that aren&rsquo;t too familiar with it, at times think of them as doctors, which can be quite funny, and dangerous!</p>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t convinced yet, take these ones for example. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAMS_Arefin_Siddique">AAMS Arefin Siddique</a> an ex-VC of the University of Dhaka, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._K._Fazlul_Huq">A. K. Fazlul Huq</a> a renowned leader in the history, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._P._J._Abdul_Kalam">A P J Abdul Kalam</a> an ex-president and a nuclear scientist from India.</p>
<p>I hope this makes you comfortable in calling me by the name Sohan :)</p>
