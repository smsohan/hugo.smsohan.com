Growing up, my dad had a huge influence on my upbringing. He had a government job and it was the only job he ever had (retired in 2012). However, my generation Y seems somewhat lucky to be able to pick and choose a job, once every couple years or so. And every time I feel like it&rsquo;s time to start looking around for that next job, I get intimidated by this question."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.108.0"><meta name=robots content="noindex, nofollow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.css><meta property="og:title" content="Career choices: Should I take this job?"><meta property="og:description" content="I get intimidated by this question, &ldquo;Should I take this job?&rdquo;

And every time I feel like it&rsquo;s time to start looking around for that next job, I get intimidated by this question.</p><p>I think this is because, I put a lot of passion into the work I do. I also feel proud of my work. So, when it gets boring, and learning opportunity gets flat, it rings that bell - &ldquo;what&rsquo;s out there?&rdquo;</p><p>We get comfortable around the people at work, build relationships and know the businesses inside out. The thought of leaving the comfort zone intimidates me. At the same time, a new work, working with new people and just a lot of learning opportunity gets me excited. So, everytime I need to solve this trade-off, it becomes a huge mental load for me. Last time, when I left ThoughtWorks, the mental load was paramount, and here&rsquo;s how I made up my mind:</p><p>I focused on the <em>worst case</em> and <em>best case</em> outcomes. For me, the worst case was if the new job I was taking would leave me jobless, right when Shopoth, my son, was due to be born. I was pretty confident that wasn&rsquo;t gonna happen until something really bad happened. The next in line was, if work and life at the new place turns out to be too bad that I&rsquo;d have to find a new job right after. If it indeed happened, I timeboxed it to at least see it for 8 months, when our new born baby would be 4 months old and we&rsquo;d possibly get somewhat settled. With these two items checked, I felt somewhat comfortable with the decision to move.</p><p>The best case for me was the opportunity to lead some innovations while making good income. Both seemed to be in place. So, I made the decision. It worked out pretty well till now. I hope the Best/Worst case outcome thing helps you in making your decision.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-navy bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://smsohan.com/>&copy; Sohan's Blog 2023</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
