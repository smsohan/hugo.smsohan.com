And I&rsquo;m happy to reach the 50 Miles milestone on day 24, happened this Saturday! 46 Miles to go now, but the target sure looks reachable from here.</p>
<p>I changed a few things on my end. After running for the first couple of weeks, I found my legs weren&rsquo;t feeling great. So, I decided to swap 700 metres of swimming as a replacement for 2 miles of running on some days. It takes me about 20 minutes to complete the 700 metres swim, and as a bonus, I get to take Shopoth for a swim lesson. So far, I&rsquo;ve been going to <a href="http://www.ymcacalgary.org/blog/category/crowfoot-ymca/">Crowfoot YMCA</a> for swimming, which is a nice 15 min walk from my home, or just a 3 minute drive. And they have open lanes pretty much any time of the day, making it quite convenient.</p>
<p>About running, I&rsquo;m following a stepped pattern of speed on the trademill as shown in the following graph:</p>
<iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MNwHXYJ5KREduERT-sNYrUn4FyEMnofH8kgW_vsb3II/pubchart?oid=131170761&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
<p>This pattern helps me since I can slow down to catch a breathe and then get back to speed, allowing the whole 2M run to finish under 20 minutes.</p>
<p>So far the act of running and swimming without a partner is not feeling weird anymore. Still early to declare victory, but I&rsquo; m genuinely feeling really excited internally. Will report back once I&rsquo;m done with my 100 miles, hopefully in the next 3 weeks time.</p>
<p>A few people showed some interest in participating in the 100 miles challenge, including <a href="http://www.mokhan.ca/">Mo Khan</a>, and I&rsquo;m hoping to see some adoption in the near future. Even if that doesn&rsquo;t happen, thank you for wishing me good luck. Insipiration matters, both intrinsic and extrinsic.</p>
