names of colleagues as references while applying for a new job. The
referees are often involved in the last stage of the hiring process,
when the employer is generally satisfied that the candidate is a
potential hire. At this stage, the employer expects to find a few
things:</p><ol><li><strong>Verification of facts.</strong> The employer wants to confirm the validity of
the information such as the role, responsibilities, and achievements
provided by the candidate about their past experience.</li><li><strong>Qualitative feedback.</strong> The employer wants to understand the &ldquo;cultural
fitness&rdquo; aspect of the candidate by asking questions related to the
individual&rsquo;s interaction and collaboration skills.</li></ol><p>While these are valid goals, I personally find the practice of using
references to achieve these goals to be a rather flawed one. Here&rsquo;s why:</p><ol><li><strong>References aren&rsquo;t replacements for interviews.</strong> As an employer,
the responsibility is on the employer to be smart enough to verify
that the skills and experiences as advertised by a candidate&rsquo;s resume
reflect the reality. If the employer can&rsquo;t do that with a reasonable
amount of confidence, they&rsquo;re likely to hire wrong candidates anyway.</li><li><strong>Likely outdated.</strong> If a candidate is currently employed, due to the
secret nature of most job searches, they are unlikely to use one of
their coworkers as the referee. As a result, the longer a candidate
is employed by the most recent employer, the more outdated the
references tend to get.</li><li><strong>Likely tampered.</strong> If a candidate wants to use a referee, they&rsquo;d
generally contact ahead of time with the referee. Even if they don&rsquo;t
contact, the candidates are likely to mention names of people that
are almost certain to say good things about them. For any qualitative
feedback, this setup limits the possibility of getting any negative
traits of a candidate.</li><li><strong>Open to interpretation.</strong> Reference checks are often done over
phone. Also, the person calling to check the reference often hasn&rsquo;t met the
candidate during the interview steps. This creates a double-blindness
of sort. So, anything said during the reference check process suffers
from possibilities of information gap.</li></ol><p>In my opinion, if reference checks are used, they should only be used
to verify factual information. That too, should be done keeping in mind
that the information may be outdated, or intentionally biased.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-navy bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://smsohan.com/>&copy; Sohan's Blog 2023</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
