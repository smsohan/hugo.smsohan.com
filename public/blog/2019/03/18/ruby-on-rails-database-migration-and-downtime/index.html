migration on one of our Ruby on Rails apps. The deployment went fine
through a few
stages, but the problem only showed up at the last and the largest
stage. This is exactly what happened during the deploy process.</p>
<ol>
<li>New code was deployed. Restart was pending, so the server was still
running old code.</li>
<li>Migrations ran.</li>
<li>One migration removed a column that was used in the old code, but no
longer used in the new code.</li>
<li>The next migration was a data migration that inserted one row / user
to a table. This was a very slow migration, taking 5+ minutes.</li>
<li>The old code failed because it tried to use a column in the database
that was no longer there. To make things worse, the column was
referenced at all page loads within the app.</li>
<li>The long running migration didn&rsquo;t finish because it ran into a
timeout.</li>
<li>The servers weren&rsquo;t restarted because the migration had failed. So,
the new code wasn&rsquo;t served at all.</li>
<li>There was no automatic database rollback to restore the system into a good
state with the old code.</li>
</ol>
<p>The team was able to resolve the issues within the next 5 minutes, but
it was the worst system outage we&rsquo;ve seen in years. For anyone dealing
with a large Ruby on Rails app, you can use the following
safeguards to avoid such problems:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do not remove a column from the database while the current code is
still using it. Do it at a later release.</strong></li>
<li>When a deployment fails at the migration step, ensure you have a
rollback policy so that the system can be automatically restored to a
known good state.</li>
<li>Consider data migrations to be a performance problem and always test
the migrations with relaistic load before production release.</li>
<li>If possible, run your data migrations seprately from schema
migrations so that you don&rsquo;t incur deployment delays for optional new
data.</li>
</ol>
