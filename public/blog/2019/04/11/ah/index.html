<p>All creators take a deep interest in the creations of others. All
filmmakers watch a lot of movies, all good writers are also the most
prolific readers, all artists can talk at length about the smallest
pieces of art they have seen.</p>
<p>We, software developers, if we want to claim ourselves as the artists of
this craft, we must be prolific readers of code. There&rsquo;s been no better
time as today. We have immediate access to millions of lines of carefully
written code out there in the internet. Just like artists of any craft,
I&rsquo;ve had so much fun spending time with my fellow developers that read
code for the pure joy of learning something new.</p>
<p>Just had so much fun reading <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activesupport/lib/active_support/core_ext/array/inquiry.rb">this ruby</a>
code today from the Ruby on Rails project:</p>

different opinions. But I hope you find your love of art in code.
There&rsquo;s plenty of art in code out there for everyone to enjoy.</p>
