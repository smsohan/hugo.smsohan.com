<p>&ldquo;I am a mango&rdquo;.</p>
<p>First, mangoes are in-season, and I still remember the
juicy sweetness of the mango I had just the night before. So, when the coach
asked each of us to be a fruit, I didn&rsquo;t think twice. One of my
coworkers was a kiwi, another one apple, and so on. The idea was to
group us
by color, then by size. This got us, twenty people in the class, moving and engaged. It was part
of a two-day design thinking course. The coaches used the fruit game to
bring some energy into the room as well as to pave the way for the next
exercise - grouping a bunch of ideas by cost and the level of
innovation.</p>
<p>I find that professional trainers bring play at work, especially for
sessions that span hours or days. However, on a typical day to day
business, I don&rsquo;t see much play activity at work. Hoping to bring in
some play activities to my work going forward. Here are some ideas for
play activities based on what I saw so far:</p>
<p>Paper planes: Having small groups build paper planes and the winner has
the most number of planes crossing a line.</p>
<p>Catch and throw: A ball or a ball-like object changing hands and the person
catching must find someone that didn&rsquo;t catch it already.</p>
<p>Portrait: Everyone draws a portrait of another person looking at their
face without looking at the paper.</p>
<p>Quiz: An online quiz that maintains a leaderboard throughout a session.</p>
<p>Exercise: Getting everyone out of their seats to do a quick one-minute
exercise.</p>
