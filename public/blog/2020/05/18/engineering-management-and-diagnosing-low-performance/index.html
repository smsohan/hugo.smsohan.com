Back in 2008, I was a couple of years out of college and working for a software company in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Like many of my classmates from my college, I was studying GRE alongside my job for a PhD admission in a reputable US university. That process being long and uncertain, I also applied for an MBA program at the University of Dhaka as a backup plan. The GRE preparation came in very handy and I qualified for the evening MBA program. I started MBA classes in January 2009 before the universities in USA and Canada made their decision on my application. There, I took a course on Management. I was too naive and still too much an engineer to pay attention.</p><p>But this image that our teacher drew on the board got stuck in my head to this day.</p><p><img src=/images/perf.jpg alt=Performance></p><p>Fast forward ten years and I still like how cleanly it captures the essence of high performance of an employee as a combination of the employee&rsquo;s ability and motivation in a suitable environment.</p><p>Given this is how high-performers are, it&rsquo;s possible to plot a similar graph for low performers as a diagnostic report. If such a diagnosis is right, it can provide a valuable strategy for managers and employees to work towards improving employee performance. For example, if an employee lacks skill and motivation but fits very well within the work environment, a manager can focus on skills training and suggesting therapies to increase motivation. Similarly, if an employee is unable to acquire the skills for a particular job, focusing on motivation or changing the environment for that employee may not fix the low performance issue.</p><p>Based on the past 14 years of my time in the industry, I&rsquo;ve shared some symptoms of low performance that I&rsquo;ve seen. You can use this as an exercise sheet to plot your diagnosis of the low performer&rsquo;s chart.</p><ol><li><p><strong>New hire too slow to ramp up:</strong> You were impressed by a candidate during the interview. The same interview process was used to find many high performers in the past. But this employee is struggling to ramp up.</p></li><li><p><strong>Knowledge vs. application:</strong> You have an employee who&rsquo;s always studying job related skills and shows a great deal of interest in training, but can&rsquo;t translate the knowledge into application.</p></li><li><p><strong>Complains about the lack of time</strong>: You have an employee struggling to produce the best outcome. In your one:one meeting, the employee always complains about lack of time even after you give him/her the time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Frequently runs into conflicts:</strong> Your dream employee is causing too many conflicts within the team.</p></li><li><p><strong>Can&rsquo;t write thoughts down:</strong> You have an employee who&rsquo;s unhappy about things. When you want them to write it down, they are unable to produce a crisp writeup about the problems and potential solutions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Doesn&rsquo;t make hard decisions timely:</strong> You have a leader that stays away from making hard decisions. In their mind, they want someone else to make them take the hard decision.</p></li><li><p><strong>Isn&rsquo;t aware of better ways to solve old problems:</strong> You have an employee who&rsquo;s expert in certain ways of delivering work but lacks awareness of newer and more efficient ways.</p></li><li><p><strong>Doesn&rsquo;t take initiative:</strong> You encourage and reward employees to take initiatives that help the business. Yet, you see an employee is not taking part.</p></li></ol><p>The good news is, once a diagnosis is accurate for such symptoms of low performance, you can move ahead and implement a concrete improvement strategy for your employee. The clarity of this simple method helped me in many situations.</p><p>I hope this helps you, too.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-navy bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://smsohan.com/>&copy; Sohan's Blog 2023</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
