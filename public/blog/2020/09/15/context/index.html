Context is everything. Due to a context mismatch projects such as exporting democracy, agile transformations, building startups, losing weight, mindfulness or anything you can think of fail to repeat.
Context is formed by why / what / who / when / where / how, each of these being a critcial part. Most often it&rsquo;s common to focus on the how alone - forgetting the rest of the context while adopting a recipe for success in business."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.108.0"><meta name=robots content="noindex, nofollow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.css><meta property="og:title" content="Context"><meta property="og:description" content="Image credits to NCinDC

Due to a context mismatch projects such as exporting democracy, agile transformations, building startups, losing weight, mindfulness or anything you can think of fail to repeat.</p><p>Context is formed by <strong>why / what / who / when / where / how</strong>, each of these being a critcial part. Most often it&rsquo;s common to focus on the how alone - forgetting the rest of the context while adopting a recipe for success in business. Some get overly <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Sinek>influenced by speakers</a> and focus on only a subset of the context. Reality is, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to find an excact duplicate of any one context. So, while copying solutions from one context, we must adapt to account for the uniqueness of our own context.</p><p>A lot of innovation lies in the context gap - where one can find clever ways to adapt solutions from one context into another. I&rsquo;ll give you one such example, did you know Uber runs a motorcycle based rideshare in <a href=https://www.uber.com/en-BD/blog/dhaka/dhaka-moto/>many countries</a>?</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-navy bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://smsohan.com/>&copy; Sohan's Blog 2023</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
