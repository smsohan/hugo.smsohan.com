I find an immense amount of happiness everytime I check the Nuget page of MvcMailer. It&rsquo;s so refreshing to see the download count going up (42,427 total downloads as I write), receiving feedback, praises and even the complains.
The idea of MvcMailer came from trying to bring some of the amazing Ruby on Rails ActionMailer features to ASP.NET MVC developers. It was well accepted since the very beginning and I hope is still helping people.

      With the help of @TylerMercier, and many active users of MvcMailer, we have just released the new API for MvcMailer. This is a summary post capturing the work and lessons learned in the process.
The bulk of the work has been done on removing hard dependencies on dll files for 3rd party libraries in favor of NuGet packages. For example, we used NUnit, for running our tests. Instead of referencing the dlls directly, we are now using the NuGet package.

      Traditionally the .NET community, or more appropriately the users of .NET framework relied on products from Microsoft - so, in a product stack you are likely to see almost everything coming from Microsoft. However, some community contribution made its way into the main stream - for example, NUnit or Log4Net. But you can literally count the number of such main stream non-Microsoft products in your development stacks with your fingers (sparing a few)!

I have always had the feeling that TDD is a kind of a misnomer because to some people the term 'Test' refers to finding bugs. For this very reason, when people gets started with TDD, they consider it as a waste of time to write so much extra code that doesn't necessarily find bugs!

      This is a simple solution for implementing wildcard replacements in your asp.net pages. You may use this, if you want to replace some tokens / merge codes in the asp.net generated html by your personalized values. System.Web.UI.Control has a virtual method called 'Render' of the following signature - protected internal virtual void Render( HtmlTextWriter writer )
Since, all your ASP.Net pages and server controls are subclasses of this Control class, you can override this method and manipulate the html that's rendered from this control.

      Usually static variables holds the same value for all the threads running at the same AppDommain. However, in a multithreaded scenario, you may need to add thread safe behavior to your static members so that the value of a static member is same inside only a single thread and across multiple threads the value can be different. In this way you may attain a thread specific or thread scoped storage to use in your application.

      Many a time when you are just about to write a foreach loop on your IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; object you need to check whether the object is null or empty in the following manner
if(myEnumerable != null || myEnumerable.Count() &gt; 0) { foreach(&lt;type&gt; item in myEnumerable) { ... } } However, with the advent of Extension methods, you can write one custom extension method like the following -
public static class IEnumerableExtensions { public static bool IsNullOrEmpty&lt;T&gt;(this IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; instance) where T : class { return instance == null || instance.

        Creating Instances of internal classes using Spring.Net

      Creating an instance of an internal class using Spring.Net is a little tricky. I know that, you can achieve this by adding an InternalsVisibleTo attribute to your assembly. However, the following solution also works as desired.
Say, you have an namespace named SampleClasses that contains the a public interface named 'IPublicInterface' and also an internal class named 'InternalClass' that implements the IPublicInterface interface and looks like the following - 1: namespace SampleClasses

      I was looking for logging solutions for the generated SQL in one of my projects where I am using LINQ to SQL. I found that sometimes the the Exceptions and StackTrace information does not say much about what's really causing the problem with LINQ to SQL queries/commands.
To see the actual SQL that's generated from LINQ you may write a code like the following-
SampleDataContext context = new SampleDataContext(); //You may wish to use any subclass of System.

        A solution to the problem with creating mocks for interfaces with Generic Methods with NMock

      I was so happy with NMock to see how it can dynamically generate mocks of interfaces and also gives me a fluent interface to write expectations and everything it does to help me in unit testing!
However, I could not generate dynamic mocks for interfaces with Generic methods and it kept showing me the 'TypeLoadException' on and on. My interface looks like the following -
interface IObjectFactory
{
T GetObject(string id);

      Recently I was writing unit test for a method of the following signature
interface ICache
{
void Insert(string key, object value, DateTime absoluteExpiration, TimeSpan slidingExpiration);
}
and I wanted to verify the following call -
Insert("key", "value", DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(30), TimeSpan.Zero);
However, you readily see the problem in verifying with the above call for the presence of DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(30) in the argument. So, a test method like the following won't work for obvious reason.

        Mock Internal Interface with NMock2 - Use InternalsVisibleToAttribute

      Yesterday I badly needed to create mocks for my internal interfaces. I am using NMock2 as a Mocking framework and found it really difficult to produce Mocks for internal interfaces. After some 'google time' and investigation I found that you need the following two lines in your AssemblyInfo.cs to achieve this purpose-
[assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("Mocks")]
[assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("MockObjects")]
Where are the two assemblies? I found that these two assemblies are dynamically created by NMock2 for mocking your interfaces.

      I have been using Spring.Net for implementing Dependency Injection in my .Net projects. Spring is already one of the most known providers of DI in the Java world and a port to .Net actually eased the lives of people like me who are willing to develop unit-testable software.
However, with all the happiness enjoyed through Spring.Net, I guess its time to take a look into Unity. I have only started using this and I found it interesting in the sense that its more of .

while (numbers.MoveNext())
