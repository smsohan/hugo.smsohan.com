Pair programming is like synchronized swimming. You do it together, you win it together. You try to improve your chances by helping your partner, and vice verca. Even if you lose, its highly likely you&rsquo;ve improved simply by being together sharing a united goal.
Code review can be fun and really useful too. But deep deep care needs to be taken to ensure it remains same in spirit, that is, the unified shared goal.

      Hello Readers:
Wish you all are doing great as the Spring already started :-)
Recently my grad courses are keeping me busy with assignments and projects as the term comes close to an end. So, I haven't had much time to spend on blogging other than posting the Ruby on Rails link blog called www.DrinkRails.com. However, for my readers, I thought I would post the recent presentation that I put for the Agile course here:

If you read the Poppendieck's book called, "Lean Software Development : An Agile Toolkit", you probably liked it because it managed to get the essence out of agile practices. So, what are these core principles? Well, most of you already know the phrase, "Inspect and Adapt". Now, you also know a bunch of specifications that facilitate this, for an instance, Scrum, XP etc.
Reading the book, I had a realization that, its good to talk using concrete facts as much as possible.

By communication, I mean the following:-Getting the spec as intended by the client.Asking specific questions on time.Status update about progress, blocks and forthcoming events.Getting feedback as intended by the client.

Back then, on Friday, May 26, 2006, I was a final year undergrad student at CSE, BUET. I was looking for a part-time software dev job opportunity and found a little one page advert for a student job at asha-technologies (lately renamed as Code71). Visited their website and thought it might be worth giving a try!
As usual, I was interviewed over phone and enjoyed a long 2 hour interview on premise.

      In my previous post, I said about being incremental. Here come the next thing, being “ITERATIVE”. A prefer the term Sprint than Iteration.
So, once you decided to take small increments, make sure you reach the targets sprinting.
I suggest you prepare for sprinting with the right techniques and tools. A few recommendations-
Never miss a daily standup meeting. Spend only 2 minutes (or less) per person answering the three questions – what did you do yesterday, what’s on the plate for today and what is blocking the race?

      As Scrum and Agile processes tell you, do it in small sprints, 2 weeks preferably, and go incremental. Take a small piece at a time and sprint. I took this image from internet and credits to this site.
It’s easy to work out the Natural way than to defy it! If you are iterative and incremental, you are reaching towards the right hand side of the image! And to make the evolution faster, I suggest you try out Scrumming with ScrumPad.

Good
I am pair programming on the ScrumPad project now and the feeling in general is good. I have this perception is the work quality is better than doing alone. Also, the amount of time wasted to find small issues are now much reduced. Overall, its good.
Productivity Increased
I definitely found the productivity boosted by a factor of 1.

Now, It's time to realize!
Start now! It's simple. I have found the following approach to be useful-
Pair up with one developer. Make it explicit to the team.

      Extreme Programming (XP) advocates for a pair-programming, taking the code review to its extreme. I have also found that pair programming generates a lot of speed and also helps producing better quality product in the first time. But, at the same time it's difficult to impress the management or prove return on investment associated with pair programming to the business people. So, what is the best possible solution? I believe, we can implement frequent peer code reviews to mimic the pair programming to some extent and get the benefit out of it.

      In Agile Software Development, for example SCRUM and XP, User Story is a tool to capture the requirements from the clients. The term User Story takes a very free form. Sometimes, we feel that there needs to be a boundary so that a user story is an effective one and not misused. I have a feeling that INVEST defines the border line on this regard.
The INVEST principle is a very good guideline for defining user stories in an agile environment.

      Up to now, I have figured out that teams trying to behave agile sometimes fall into the cave of pretending to be agile (e.g. stand up meetings and less than just enough planning and short iterations so on!). Often, when this pretending takes places for days, it creates a illusion on the minds of the people that they might be doing the "right thing". And all on a sudden, someone discovers things are breaking and there is no way out of this disaster!

I will point to the two aspects as,
1. Management aspects.
2. Technical aspects.
1. Management aspects
I encapsulate the things like working on a story by story basis, standing up for daily status update meeting, producing deliveries in short iterations and without much of prior planning into this group.
