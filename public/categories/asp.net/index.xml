Now, the social links and buttons are no longer from a third-party source, its straight from Microsoft.

method(type argument)
{
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;if(argument == null){
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;throw new ArgumentNullException("argument")
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;}
...
}
So, in total this pattern introduces 312 lines of duplicate code without whitespaces and 644 lines of duplicate code including whitespaces. And the pattern is simple, just check a condition and throw exception if its true.</description></item><item><title>Looking at ASP.NET MVC</title><link>http://smsohan.com/blog/2009/04/05/looking-at-aspnet-mvc/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Apr 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://smsohan.com/blog/2009/04/05/looking-at-aspnet-mvc/</guid><description>Being over-burdened by all the blog posts on MVC from the ASP.Net for the last few months, I am now looking to ASP.Net MVC. Still seeing the tutorials on asp.net/mvc site.
I have worked on a few rails projects and the ASP.Net MVC implementation is very much like Rails. Anyway, still early for me to comment!
Comments Sohan @Tanvir,Yes, I read the first chapter. My finding is ASP.Net MVC is still far from being real!</description></item><item><title>Asp.Net Membership: How to change a user's password from an admin account without knowing the current password?</title><link>http://smsohan.com/blog/2008/12/23/aspnet-membership-how-to-change-user/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://smsohan.com/blog/2008/12/23/aspnet-membership-how-to-change-user/</guid><description>Like mine, you may also need to change a user's password from an admin account. By default, when you are using ASP.Net authentication and storing the password in the hashed format, you will not be able to see the existing password in its decrypted form. Also, to change a password using the Membership API, you will need to know the existing password. However, here is a simple solution to the problem -</description></item><item><title>Solution to JavaScript File Include Problem From ASP.Net MasterPage</title><link>http://smsohan.com/blog/2008/12/23/solution-to-javascript-file-include/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://smsohan.com/blog/2008/12/23/solution-to-javascript-file-include/</guid><description>You can include javascript files using a simple script tag. However, you will soon discover that, when you are using this master page from content pages that are at different levels in folder hierarchy then the script files will be missing at some cases. This is due to the fact that, script file paths are referenced relative to the content page and NOT to the master page. As a result, despite having the correct include wrt the master page, your content pages may still miss the scripts!</description></item><item><title>Simple Wildcard replacement on the Rendered Html of Asp.Net Page</title><link>http://smsohan.com/blog/2008/08/11/simple-wildcard-replacement-on-rendered/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Aug 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://smsohan.com/blog/2008/08/11/simple-wildcard-replacement-on-rendered/</guid><description>This is a simple solution for implementing wildcard replacements in your asp.net pages. You may use this, if you want to replace some tokens / merge codes in the asp.net generated html by your personalized values. System.Web.UI.Control has a virtual method called 'Render' of the following signature - protected internal virtual void Render( HtmlTextWriter writer )
Since, all your ASP.Net pages and server controls are subclasses of this Control class, you can override this method and manipulate the html that's rendered from this control.</description></item><item><title>Simple Article on REST using WCF</title><link>http://smsohan.com/blog/2008/06/08/simple-article-on-rest-using-wcf/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://smsohan.com/blog/2008/06/08/simple-article-on-rest-using-wcf/</guid><description>For a few days, I have been trying a lot to understand why people would be using RESTful instead of the standard SOAP based Web Services. I thought, I could better understand by building one little RESTfully architected application myself.
After a few google searches, I found that WCF has some attribute based programming support for implementing a RESTful architecture. MSDN has a good document on the whole WebGet and WebInvoke attributes.</description></item><item><title>Page_ClientValidate - Use this Method from Javascript for ASP.Net Client Side Validation</title><link>http://smsohan.com/blog/2008/05/11/pageclientvalidate-use-this-method-from/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://smsohan.com/blog/2008/05/11/pageclientvalidate-use-this-method-from/</guid><description>In a typical ASP.Net web form, we have a few controls and also validators associated with the controls. The most common validators are used for Required Field validation, Type validation, Regular Expression validation and so on.
When we want to logically group the validators in a web form, we apply the same value for ValidationGroup property on the controls of a group and in this way, we create a logical division among our controls and the validation.</description></item><item><title>Best RSS Feed I have read today</title><link>http://smsohan.com/blog/2008/04/09/best-rss-feed-i-have-read-today/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://smsohan.com/blog/2008/04/09/best-rss-feed-i-have-read-today/</guid><description>Many a times, if feels great to know about the online users and some more details about them when they are on your website.
