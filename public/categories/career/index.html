This post is dedicated to my team at Cisco. I put a lot of my passion and care into building and being part of a great team during my time at Cisco, eight amazing years between 2012 to 2020.

Online-courses: I love O&rsquo;Reilly learning. Their video courses are split into 5 minute lectures. For example, I took their Kotlin course to learn the language. Books: Books are great for curated content, but it takes dedicated time. Most of the time, I have one book that I read.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/2020/11/12/learn-to-get-and-give-feedback/ class="link black dim">Learn to Get and Give Feedback</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Photo credits to GotCredit
Here’s a personal story about getting a feedback. For context, English is my second language. I grew up speaking Bangla as my primary language. I learned reading and writing English in school - grammar first. I had only started speaking English much later in my life, in my mid-twenties. So, I often struggle with the informal form of the language.

When we work together, let&rsquo;s do this:
Trust is only earned when it&rsquo;s mutual. Let&rsquo;s work with this shared belief.
Context is everything. Most importantly, show me why we need to work on something. If the answer isn&rsquo;t clear in your mind, we can work together to build a crisp context.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/2019/06/27/internal-trainings/ class="link black dim">Internal Trainings</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Design Thinking course, Cisco Calgary Office, AB, 2019 One benefit of working at Cisco is access to the many learning and development resources. Our learning and development org arranges hundreds of courses throughout the year. Moreover, we have a reimbursement program for external courses, conferences, books, and subscriptions to online learning programs and publications.
In the past 6 years, I have immensely benefitted from these resources. Here&rsquo;s a list of the learning resources I&rsquo;ve used.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/2017/09/07/on-reference-checks-donts/ class="link black dim">On Reference Checks: Don'ts</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Most people eventually come across a time when they&rsquo;d need to provide names of colleagues as references while applying for a new job. The referees are often involved in the last stage of the hiring process, when the employer is generally satisfied that the candidate is a potential hire. At this stage, the employer expects to find a few things:
Verification of facts. The employer wants to confirm the validity of the information such as the role, responsibilities, and achievements provided by the candidate about their past experience.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/2017/02/28/so-you-want-to-be-a-software-developer-where-to-start/ class="link black dim">So you want to be a software developer.
