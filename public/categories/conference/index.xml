      <description>Gone are the days when I used to go to a ton of local developer meetups. After Polyglot YYC, this was the second conference I joined this year. This was a 50/50 event for me in terms of like vs. dislike. Here goes my notes:&#xA;Ix-Chel Ruiz presented the keynote to start the day.

      <description>Source: Polyglot YYC This weekend I went to Polyglot YYC 2019. It&amp;rsquo;s a gathering of tech people from around Calgary. The event was open to all possible topics, hence the name Polyglot. It was the first unconference style meetup I went to and this post is a summary of my day.&#xA;About the attendees, I don&amp;rsquo;t have the official count, but I imagine there were close to a hundred people.</description>
