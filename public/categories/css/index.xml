      <description>Across different projects, I have found people taking CSS shortcuts for translating the Photoshopped design templates into HTML.

However, with CSS styling the extra flexibility to put elements in any arbitrary layout came extra responsibility - to make sure things still align nicely while being fluid to accommodate different screen resolutions and form factors.</description>
