      My 2021 resolution was to be more mindful. But I made the rookie mistake of having a goal without metrics and a clear strategy. So, I can’t tell if I was indeed more mindful or not. In this post, I’m sharing some highlights from my 2021, in a random order. I personally find it fascinating to look at these at a later time.

      Most applications have a request-response based single-channel data-flow. In such systems, human or software triggered requests are served by software provided responses. For example, when you make your DuckDuckGo search, you initiate a request and their server produces a response back to you. Realtime multiplayer systems are quite different because the pattern of information flow is more complex, often being a two-way or many-to-many data flow, with strict latency constraints. For example, when you chat with a bunch of friends, or join them for a video call, the data-flow is quite different than when you watch a YouTube video.

If you aren&rsquo;t familiar with MongoDB, it&rsquo;s a distributed database that allows you to store and query humongous amounts of JSON-like data.
To get an overview of MongoDB and its architecture, you can watch the following YouTube video:

For today&rsquo;s post, let&rsquo;s focus on learning from a very popular and commonly used open-source project called Redis. To the developers, Redis is a dead simple key-value store with a super simple API as follows:
$ set today &#39;Thursday&#39; OK $ get today Thursday $ set temp 20 OK $ incr temp 21 $ incrby temp 3 24 $ get temp 24 Of course Redis has more advanced features, but not too many.

      An architect first needs to write for herself, and then for her team. Let me explain a bit.
An architect takes the trio of requirements, people, and environment, and does her research to design the most delightful system. In her research process, she uses her past experience as well as the experience of others. Even a moderately complex system design involves a lot of trade-offs without clear winners. For example, given that there are tens of different databases one can choose, how can she recommend a specific one?

      To be an architect, you&rsquo;ll have to be a leader. And, to be a leader, you&rsquo;ll have to be able to understand people and create an influence on them. So, focusing on the people involved with a system is a pre-requisite for designing systems that delight them.

Here’s a personal story about getting a feedback. For context, English is my second language. I grew up speaking Bangla as my primary language. I learned reading and writing English in school - grammar first. I had only started speaking English much later in my life, in my mid-twenties.

      Most people eventually come across a time when they&rsquo;d need to provide names of colleagues as references while applying for a new job. The referees are often involved in the last stage of the hiring process, when the employer is generally satisfied that the candidate is a potential hire. At this stage, the employer expects to find a few things:
Verification of facts. The employer wants to confirm the validity of the information such as the role, responsibilities, and achievements provided by the candidate about their past experience.

      No matter which side of the table you&rsquo;ve sat during interviews, you&rsquo;ve probably heard this question: &lsquo;Why do you want this new job?&rsquo;
In the recent past, I&rsquo;ve interviewed a few candidates and heard the following answers so far:
I&rsquo;m not learning much on the current job after it&rsquo;s been 2-4 years. I&rsquo;m looking for something that offers better work-life balance. I&rsquo;m not really looking for a job. The recruiters got in touch and I thought I&rsquo;d discuss.

      For an opinionated framework like Ruby on Rails, I expect it to come pre-bundled with a CoffeeScript based test framework and test runner. Here&rsquo;s why:
Teams don&rsquo;t need to waste time deciding which one to use among the mess of Jasmine, Mocha, Expect, Sinon, Chai, Bower, Grunt, Teaspoon, Npm&hellip; you name it.
It&rsquo;d work better than what&rsquo;s out there since the Rails team will focus on clean integration with Rails and will have a much larger user base to collect contribution from.

class Cat type: -&gt; &#39;cat&#39; meow: -&gt; &#39;meow meow mee..ow&#39; The compiler produces this in JavaScript:
var Cat; Cat = (function() { function Cat() {} Cat.prototype.type = function() { return &#39;cat&#39;; }; Cat.prototype.meow = function() { return &#39;meow meow mee..ow&#39;; }; return Cat; })(); As you see here, the prototype method definitions use the prefix Cat.

      Software architecture, or any design for that matter, needs to strike a fine balance between simplicity and power. Sometimes, the design needs to deliberately remove elements that&rsquo;d make life better in some way but also cause a lot of frictions in other ways, ways that may not really impact the designer.
A few examples to explain this. Client side MVC frameworks on top of a server side MVC framework. Client side URL routing on top of server side URL routing.

This 2006 MSDN article points out some key aspects of designing a multi-tenant database for SaaS applications. As you can read in the article, SaaS databases need to pick one of the following three configurations:
separate databases shared database, separate schema and shared database, shared schema. A number of factors including economic, security, skillset, etc. contribute to the selection of the best suitable configuration.

      I find the MongoDB API is abusing JSON in a really bad way. JSON is probably a good format for storing the documents in MongoDB, but using JSON for it&rsquo;s weird API is simply a terrible idea. Here&rsquo;s an example from the SQL to Aggregation Framework Mapping Chart
db.orders.aggregate( [ { $group: { _id: { cust_id: &#34;$cust_id&#34;, ord_date: &#34;$ord_date&#34; }, total: { $sum: &#34;$price&#34; } } }, { $match: { total: { $gt: 250 } } } ] ) I find the UI of this query to be distasteful at the best.

      Often times the business requirements demand for database features that aren&rsquo;t easily achievable using a single type of database. And now we have quite a few options to choose from, for example Key Value stores, Document databases, Relational databases etc, each providing some mutually exclusive features from the rest. So, it can be tempting to introduce multiple databases to rip the benefits of each.
But, it comes with a few gotchas that are worth knowing.

      Input validation is often required to safe guard against inappropriate use. For example, consider the following API:

Say, a simple validation would do this:

      Yes to ORM, No to custom queries. Here&rsquo;s a bullet list:
You&rsquo;d probably end up writing your own ORM anyway. Doing so, you&rsquo;d spend a lot of money writing library level code instead of your business logic. The time tested ones are likely to be better than yours. Beware, you&rsquo;d have to figure out some complex issues: connection pooling, concurrency/locking, caching, transactions, updates, versioning, documentation etc. If you find yourself ORM is falling short of what you need, you&rsquo;re either presenting information overload or using a transactional database as a reporting store.

      Naming conventions play an important role to the software's overall architecture. It is not a rocket science, still, it may lead to unhappy consequences if not taken care of at the early stage of a project. This small best practices can make a code base significantly improved.
Rails does a good job by using the dynamic power of ruby and providing with a handful of dynamic methods with the models.

During typical developer interviews, I solved coding and system design problems and discussed personal aspirations in behavioral interviews. In contrast, leadership interview qeustions were really open-ended. Honestly, I found it very hard to answer these questions concisely.

Context is everything. Due to a context mismatch projects such as exporting democracy, agile transformations, building startups, losing weight, mindfulness or anything you can think of fail to repeat.
Context is formed by why / what / who / when / where / how, each of these being a critcial part. Most often it&rsquo;s common to focus on the how alone - forgetting the rest of the context while adopting a recipe for success in business.

      2013 was an amazing year in many ways for my personal life. To recap, the top story of 2013 was of course the birth of our son, Shopoth. And then, we bought our first house, paid off our car-loan and ended the year with a much needed vacation, that too to Bangladesh where we spent some quality time with the families.
2013 was my year of learning Haskell. I can&rsquo;t claim to be a seasoned Haskell programmer yet.

      I like the idea of learning one new programming language every year. This is also mentioned at The Pragmatic Programmer Book. I&rsquo;m now looking for a new language to learn.
In 2011, I learned F#, my first functional programming language experience. It&rsquo;s a really nice language, especially if you&rsquo;re familiar with the .Net class library and the windows development echo system in general. This was really fun, learned the basic concepts and building blocks of functional languages.

      Any kind of configuration file, be it an ugly xml file or a prettier yml or properties file, its been a source of frustration to me. Here's a list of few such pain points:
There are two config keys that point to the same value. e.g. db_username=master, data_source_user=masterThere are two config keys for urls that point to the same domain, but different paths. e.g. market.com/cameras and market.com/undiesConfig entries with placeholders.

      Code review, as any other review process, can often be an attack on someone's ego and incite anger and frustration. Being both on sending and receiving end of such code reviews for years, I have learned a few how-not-to-do-it, or as one might say, anti-patterns of providing code review feedback. Let me know if you agree/disagree with me on the following:
You are always reviewing Adam's code while Adam is never reviewing yours.

User Experience: I find a good user experience is THE thing that you want in anything you design, and if you are writing a software, its even more important. After I read a few books, I have a feeling that its not just a common sense approach, it takes some education and a deep care to produce something usable.

I will go short, just touching the bits...Teaming is at the core of Code71's culture.

As usual, I was interviewed over phone and enjoyed a long 2 hour interview on premise.

The following command will preserve the attributes -
cp -p source destination here, the switch p (-p) does the trick, it preserves the permissions, modes and other attributes to resemble the source.

So, we put a lot of thought into it and propose our plan to the team hoping the following reaction:

      Beginning with a story here. Back in 2008, I was a couple of years out of college and working for a software company in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Like many of my classmates from my college, I was studying GRE alongside my job for a PhD admission in a reputable US university. That process being long and uncertain, I also applied for an MBA program at the University of Dhaka as a backup plan.

Thinking about how I spend my idle time, I realized that I missed two things that I actually love and spend a fair amount of time on: stock markets and reading open-source code.

Ix-Chel Ruiz presented the keynote to start the day. Her storytelling style reminded me of WWII movies, where a lot of cloudy and gloomy scene keep getting darker and darker, ending with a deep sense of sadness.

      Looking at our git logs from Cisco AMP for Endpoints Console, I see that we introduced feature flags back in January, 2014. The reason I got interested in it is because even after all these years of use, today I had to build a new concept on our feature flag code. If you&rsquo;re already using feature flags or thinking about adding feature flags to your project, this experience report may be helpful.

      It used to be pretty straight forward to get up and running with a Rails app. You&rsquo;d expect something like the following:
git clone git@blah/blah.git cd blah bundle rake db:migrate rails s If the project is using rvm and bundler, the ruby versions and gem depdendencies are all taken care of. So far life is good this way.
But it starts getting complicated. For example, your project probably uses MySQL and no matter what, I can&rsquo;t remeber all the c libraries that are pre-requisites for the mysql2 gem to actually install successfully.

A careful look at an exeption has often led to quick discovery of the source of a trouble. On the flip side, I have also faced a lot of chaotic debugging sessions because of poor exception handling. Here, I present the common anti-patterns that I recommend fixing while reviewing pull-requests. Most programmers are already familiar with the mechanics of exception handling.

New code was deployed. Restart was pending, so the server was still running old code. Migrations ran. One migration removed a column that was used in the old code, but no longer used in the new code.

Only use them when the behavior is must have under all situations, including your tests. For example, we know email addresses are case-insensitive. So no matter what, we may always want to store a lower cased version in the db. #Good class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base before_save :downcase_email def downcase_email email.

Most problems are solved inefficiently. Innovation follows when a problem is researched first.
I spent a fair amount of time in grad school. First, sixteen months on my MSc, and then another forty eight months on my PhD program. Also, I worked as a pro software engineer for 20 hours/week during my MSc days and then full-time during the PhD days.

A great technology only becomes so because people feel happy about it. The happiness for people like me comes from the fact that not only I understand the technology well, but also find it to be easy to use.

AngularJS works by extending HTML to produce declarative UI code and eliminating the need for a lot of boilerplate code. For example, the mental model of a wizard can be expressed using the following HTML:
&lt;wizard title=&#34;Flight Search&#34;&gt; &lt;step title=&#34;Search&#34;&gt; &lt;/step&gt; &lt;step title=&#34;Select a flight&#34;&gt; &lt;/step&gt; &lt;step title=&#34;Select a return flight&#34;&gt; &lt;/step&gt; &lt;step title=&#34;Checkout&#34;&gt; &lt;/step&gt; &lt;step title=&#34;Confirm purchase&#34;&gt; &lt;/step&gt; &lt;step title=&#34;Receipt&#34;&gt; &lt;/step&gt; &lt;/wizard&gt; With AngularJS, one can write exactly this markup with the help of two custom directives, widget and step.

      Just worked on my first AngularJS project at http://loveyyc.info (source code) and wanted to share my thoughts about it while the memory is still fresh. My impression in a one-liner:
AngularJS needs to rename a lot of things and introduce higher level abstraction
A great technology only becomes so because people feel happy about it. The happiness for people like me comes from the fact that not only I understand the technology well, but also find it to be easy to use.

      Introducing Asset Pipeline to an old project is quite hard. Most pre-asset pipeline projects used small JavaScript/CSS files that are often scoped to a single page or a part of the application. A typical example is as follows:
$(function(){ $(&#39;#login&#39;).on(&#39;click&#39;, function(){ var isLoginValid = hasValue($(&#39;#user_name&#39;)) &amp;&amp; hasValue($(&#39;#user_password&#39;)); if(isLoginValid){ $(&#39;#login_errors&#39;).hide(); $(&#39;#login_form&#39;).submit(); } else { $(&#39;#login_errors&#39;).show(); return false; } }); }); Now, within the scope of the login page this code executes just fine.

      After spending about 6 months on this new project using BackboneJS, and spending some hours learning AngularJS and EmberJS, my realization at this point is:
Use Client-Side MVC very Selectively.
Sometimes on a single page of your app, you need to offer a lot of interactions, each scoped to a small part of the page only. In such cases Client-Side MVC offers some neat features. I&rsquo;ll try to share my perspective with some concrete examples where I&rsquo;d say yes/no to Client-Side MVC.

I was working on a web project that lets you delete some records using Ajax. The following is just an example, but you might be familiar with a similar code already:
This code used to work when the DELETE endpoint was indeed under '/blog/posts'. However, at some point a developer wants to remove the '/blog' from all the endpoints to put them directly under '/posts'! You can see, in such cases it is very hard to catch the bug that would be caused by the faulty JS code.

      I find the problems with cross-browser issues with Javascript to be bothering at times. Also, I am most annoyed with Javascript because, with Javascript, I need to think about another programming language along with my server side programming. I have a feeling that Javascript codes make the web application harder to test using various automated test frameworks and adds complexities as there are different browsers who interpret the Javascript code in different ways.

Squeel lets you rewrite... Article.where [&#39;created_at &gt;= ?&#39;, 2.weeks.ago] ...as... Article.where{created_at &gt;= 2.weeks.ago} This is a good thing. If you don&#39;t agree, Squeel might not be for you. At work, we are migrating a Rails 3.0 project into Rails 3.2. We used MetaSearch in the project quite extensively and now discussing if using Squeel (successor of MetaSearch for newer Rails versions) would be a good decision.

I was reviewing a Ruby on Rails source code to see the security implementations they have so far. They are about to launch their product for the first release and wanted to ensure they have the most obvious things checked. So, in a sense it was not supposed to be a hacking job for me, rather to check if the most well known security measures are in place.

Ruby is a self-sustained language. As a language this is completely ignorant of the Rails Framework. So, I think there is no dependency from Ruby to Rails.

      I was taking a look into the fresh ActiveModel module of Rails 3 as of github revision #100644. Here is what I learned:
Learned about new feature called autoload. Rails Inside has a small yet useful autoload example here. It is a mechanism to lazy load your modules, so delaying the load unless the module methods are actually called. A call to autoload simply marks it as a potential include, but the actual include takes place only when you first use something on that module.

      Naming conventions play an important role to the software's overall architecture. It is not a rocket science, still, it may lead to unhappy consequences if not taken care of at the early stage of a project. This small best practices can make a code base significantly improved.
Rails does a good job by using the dynamic power of ruby and providing with a handful of dynamic methods with the models.

The links of the breadcrumb may contain dynamic links. It is used in all the pages. So, changing the breadcrumb may trigger a series of changes. In ScrumPad, we are using ruby on rails. There are a few plugins to help rails projects in managing breadcrumbs, but none seemed to satisfy our need.

      At ScrumPad most of our controllers are bounded by filters for authentication/authorization. Some filters apply to all actions in a controller while others apply to only a few or leave out only a few. However, since we are following TDD, we need to test the filter is invoked before each of the desired action. This makes the test code MOIST (not DRY)!

end

      In doing rails unit testing, sometime you need to assert the equality between two float objects in the following fashion

The internal storage of float objects sometimes will contain 32.8 with additional lower precision decimal points and hence the assert may fail although the significant digits may be same. For example, the value of object_under_test.method_returning_float may be stored as 32.80000001 in memory and the above call may fail.

      Following the previous post, I decided to spin off a little ruby gem for you folks. Get streamy_csv, and write only your application code while it&rsquo;ll do the boilerplate work for you.
In a nutshell, with this gem in your application, all you need to do is this:
Class ExportsController def index stream_csv(&#39;data.csv&#39;, MyModel.header_row) do |rows| MyModel.find_each do |my_model| rows &lt;&lt; my_model.to_csv_row end end end end Find more at https://github.com/smsohan/streamy_csv

Quoting from Squeel&rsquo;s Github README page,
Squeel lets you rewrite... Article.where [&#39;created_at &gt;= ?&#39;, 2.weeks.ago] ...as... Article.where{created_at &gt;= 2.weeks.ago} This is a good thing. If you don&#39;t agree, Squeel might not be for you. At work, we are migrating a Rails 3.0 project into Rails 3.2. We used MetaSearch in the project quite extensively and now discussing if using Squeel (successor of MetaSearch for newer Rails versions) would be a good decision.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Modules in Ruby are like classes with a few important differences. One of the differences is, a module cannot inherit from another module using the same syntax as class inheritance. However, its pretty easy to inherit a module's method into another module, by just using the include ModuleToInclude syntax. Here's an example if you are looking for one:

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Ruby has a nice little keyword called unless, that checks the opposite of if. So, you are probably used to a code like this:
return customer.first_name unless customer.nil?
If you haven't used present? before, you can in fact turn the above unless into a more familiar and easy to understand if statement:
return customer.first_name if customer.present?
So, in most cases when you are using unless with a negative condition, you can use present?

endNow, prior to Rails 3, or ActionMailer 3, you would write the following to actually call this method to get the benefits of ActionMailer magics, such as finding the view based on method name and so on:

I was reviewing a Ruby on Rails source code to see the security implementations they have so far. They are about to launch their product for the first release and wanted to ensure they have the most obvious things checked. So, in a sense it was not supposed to be a hacking job for me, rather to check if the most well known security measures are in place.

Ruby is a self-sustained language. As a language this is completely ignorant of the Rails Framework. So, I think there is no dependency from Ruby to Rails.

Learned about new feature called autoload. Rails Inside has a small yet useful autoload example here. It is a mechanism to lazy load your modules, so delaying the load unless the module methods are actually called. A call to autoload simply marks it as a potential include, but the actual include takes place only when you first use something on that module.

      I worked on the following story:-"As a partner, when I visit a project's dashboard I want to see five most recently started or updated discussion threads with number of unread comments, if any. If any of these are new, I want to see them in a highlighted view. Next, if I open the thread, I want to see all new comments in a highlighted view as well. However, once seen, the threads/comments should no longer be highlighted from the rest.

      Rails models are no exception compared to the super models! You are in the business if and only if you got a good physical structure and can stick to it for years...
At Code71, we are keeping our rails models attractive following a few guidelines. I will be posting these guidelines in a series and here goes the first one - about the physical structure of the ruby on rails models.

      Naming conventions play an important role to the software's overall architecture. It is not a rocket science, still, it may lead to unhappy consequences if not taken care of at the early stage of a project. This small best practices can make a code base significantly improved.
Rails does a good job by using the dynamic power of ruby and providing with a handful of dynamic methods with the models.

      In most web applications, breadcrumbs offer a nice way to trace back to previously visited pages. However, generating the breadcrumbs and showing them on dynamic pages sometimes need special care for the following reasons-
The links of the breadcrumb may contain dynamic links. It is used in all the pages. So, changing the breadcrumb may trigger a series of changes. In ScrumPad, we are using ruby on rails. There are a few plugins to help rails projects in managing breadcrumbs, but none seemed to satisfy our need.

      At ScrumPad most of our controllers are bounded by filters for authentication/authorization. Some filters apply to all actions in a controller while others apply to only a few or leave out only a few. However, since we are following TDD, we need to test the filter is invoked before each of the desired action. This makes the test code MOIST (not DRY)!
Example of Moist Code:
The following example only captures two test methods.

StoryDeleteNotAllowedErrorThese exceptions are really useful in my application. But the bad thing is, they all derive from StandardError class, whereas there should be a base class, may be StoryError, which is more meaningful and useful. So, we can have the following-

      To avoid the n+1 problem, you need to use eager loading in ActiveRecord object associations. An easy implementation of eager loading can be done using named scope in the following way.
class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
has_many :friends
named_scope :eager_load_friends, :include =&gt; :fiends
end
User.find(user_id).eager_load_friendsTo unit test the named scope, you can use this following helper method (keep it in test_helper.rb, if you like) that I wrote for ScrumPad

The Problem/Job in Hand
Add an action switch_project to all the controllers (&gt; 20) of the ScrumPad code base. The implementations of the switch_project method will be same for all the controllers only other than the fact that, the switching destination will be different.

      In doing rails unit testing, sometime you need to assert the equality between two float objects in the following fashion
assert_equal 32.8, object_under_test.method_returning_float
The internal storage of float objects sometimes will contain 32.8 with additional lower precision decimal points and hence the assert may fail although the significant digits may be same. For example, the value of object_under_test.method_returning_float may be stored as 32.80000001 in memory and the above call may fail.

I am a big believer of Test Driven Development and doing TDD for about two years now. I have always had the feeling that TDD is a kind of a misnomer because to some people the term 'Test' refers to finding bugs. For this very reason, when people gets started with TDD, they consider it as a waste of time to write so much extra code that doesn't necessarily find bugs!

I find an immense amount of happiness everytime I check the Nuget page of MvcMailer. It&rsquo;s so refreshing to see the download count going up (42,427 total downloads as I write), receiving feedback, praises and even the complains.
The idea of MvcMailer came from trying to bring some of the amazing Ruby on Rails ActionMailer features to ASP.NET MVC developers. It was well accepted since the very beginning and I hope is still helping people.

The bulk of the work has been done on removing hard dependencies on dll files for 3rd party libraries in favor of NuGet packages. For example, we used NUnit, for running our tests. Instead of referencing the dlls directly, we are now using the NuGet package.

      Traditionally the .NET community, or more appropriately the users of .NET framework relied on products from Microsoft - so, in a product stack you are likely to see almost everything coming from Microsoft. However, some community contribution made its way into the main stream - for example, NUnit or Log4Net. But you can literally count the number of such main stream non-Microsoft products in your development stacks with your fingers (sparing a few)!

      This is a simple solution for implementing wildcard replacements in your asp.net pages. You may use this, if you want to replace some tokens / merge codes in the asp.net generated html by your personalized values. System.Web.UI.Control has a virtual method called 'Render' of the following signature - protected internal virtual void Render( HtmlTextWriter writer )
Since, all your ASP.Net pages and server controls are subclasses of this Control class, you can override this method and manipulate the html that's rendered from this control.

      Usually static variables holds the same value for all the threads running at the same AppDommain. However, in a multithreaded scenario, you may need to add thread safe behavior to your static members so that the value of a static member is same inside only a single thread and across multiple threads the value can be different. In this way you may attain a thread specific or thread scoped storage to use in your application.

      Yesterday I badly needed to create mocks for my internal interfaces. I am using NMock2 as a Mocking framework and found it really difficult to produce Mocks for internal interfaces. After some 'google time' and investigation I found that you need the following two lines in your AssemblyInfo.cs to achieve this purpose-
[assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("Mocks")]
[assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("MockObjects")]
Where are the two assemblies? I found that these two assemblies are dynamically created by NMock2 for mocking your interfaces.

However, with all the happiness enjoyed through Spring.Net, I guess its time to take a look into Unity. I have only started using this and I found it interesting in the sense that its more of .

      From my experience with writing/reading unit tests for years, here&rsquo;s a little guideline to keep &rsquo;em readable:
A unit test needs to fit entirely (including setups) on a screen without scrolling. It is OK to have a little bit of duplication in unit tests for readability. Avoid nesting of contexts beyond 2 levels. Instead, use methods to setup and flatten. Do not use if/else/loops in a unit test. If your test needs too much setup/mocking/stubbing, time to refactor the code.

      If your unit test code needs a sleep, its time to refactor it. Ideally, you&rsquo;d only need to stub/mock the asynchronous call instead of introducing arbitrary sleeps in the test code, because they will eventually fail. Moreover, until it fails, it will slow down your test runner.

However, since we are following TDD, we need to test the filter is invoked before each of the desired action. This makes the test code MOIST (not DRY)!

I have always had the feeling that TDD is a kind of a misnomer because to some people the term 'Test' refers to finding bugs. For this very reason, when people gets started with TDD, they consider it as a waste of time to write so much extra code that doesn't necessarily find bugs!

b. A method that takes some parameters, and limits its operations only on the supplied parameters and local variables and returns some value or throws exception is also very easy to write a test for.

Methods with void return types incur complexities in writing unit tests. So, we need to characterize the void methods to make sure we have guards against the odds for testability.
A typical void method without any parameter looks like the following
public void DoSomething()
{
//1.modifies some member variables
this.someMemberVariable = 10;
//2.Calls methods of the same class or other classes
someClass.SomeOtherMethod(someArg);

If you read the Poppendieck's book called, "Lean Software Development : An Agile Toolkit", you probably liked it because it managed to get the essence out of agile practices. So, what are these core principles? Well, most of you already know the phrase, "Inspect and Adapt". Now, you also know a bunch of specifications that facilitate this, for an instance, Scrum, XP etc.
Reading the book, I had a realization that, its good to talk using concrete facts as much as possible.

      Ever since I started working in the software industry, as a freelancer or representing a company, I found the most challenging part of a remote software development project is "Communication". In agile setup, collaboration plays a leading role to be effective and efficient.
By communication, I mean the following:-Getting the spec as intended by the client.Asking specific questions on time.Status update about progress, blocks and forthcoming events.Getting feedback as intended by the client.

Back then, on Friday, May 26, 2006, I was a final year undergrad student at CSE, BUET. I was looking for a part-time software dev job opportunity and found a little one page advert for a student job at asha-technologies (lately renamed as Code71). Visited their website and thought it might be worth giving a try!
As usual, I was interviewed over phone and enjoyed a long 2 hour interview on premise.

So, once you decided to take small increments, make sure you reach the targets sprinting.
I suggest you prepare for sprinting with the right techniques and tools. A few recommendations-
Never miss a daily standup meeting. Spend only 2 minutes (or less) per person answering the three questions – what did you do yesterday, what’s on the plate for today and what is blocking the race?

It’s easy to work out the Natural way than to defy it! If you are iterative and incremental, you are reaching towards the right hand side of the image! And to make the evolution faster, I suggest you try out Scrumming with ScrumPad.

Good
I am pair programming on the ScrumPad project now and the feeling in general is good. I have this perception is the work quality is better than doing alone. Also, the amount of time wasted to find small issues are now much reduced. Overall, its good.
Productivity Increased

      Extreme Programming (XP) advocates for a pair-programming, taking the code review to its extreme. I have also found that pair programming generates a lot of speed and also helps producing better quality product in the first time. But, at the same time it's difficult to impress the management or prove return on investment associated with pair programming to the business people. So, what is the best possible solution? I believe, we can implement frequent peer code reviews to mimic the pair programming to some extent and get the benefit out of it.

      In Agile Software Development, for example SCRUM and XP, User Story is a tool to capture the requirements from the clients. The term User Story takes a very free form. Sometimes, we feel that there needs to be a boundary so that a user story is an effective one and not misused. I have a feeling that INVEST defines the border line on this regard.
The INVEST principle is a very good guideline for defining user stories in an agile environment.

      Up to now, I have figured out that teams trying to behave agile sometimes fall into the cave of pretending to be agile (e.g. stand up meetings and less than just enough planning and short iterations so on!). Often, when this pretending takes places for days, it creates a illusion on the minds of the people that they might be doing the "right thing". And all on a sudden, someone discovers things are breaking and there is no way out of this disaster!

1. Management aspects.
2. Technical aspects.
1. Management aspects
I encapsulate the things like working on a story by story basis, standing up for daily status update meeting, producing deliveries in short iterations and without much of prior planning into this group.

Pair programming is like synchronized swimming. You do it together, you win it together. You try to improve your chances by helping your partner, and vice verca. Even if you lose, its highly likely you&rsquo;ve improved simply by being together sharing a united goal.
Code review can be fun and really useful too. But deep deep care needs to be taken to ensure it remains same in spirit, that is, the unified shared goal.

Let&rsquo;s say we have a list of locations, stored in a database table as follows:
Locations (location_id (primary key), province_id (NULL), city_id (NOT NULL)) And say, we want to present a list of locations sorted by &ldquo;address&rdquo;.

      Traditionally the .NET community, or more appropriately the users of .NET framework relied on products from Microsoft - so, in a product stack you are likely to see almost everything coming from Microsoft. However, some community contribution made its way into the main stream - for example, NUnit or Log4Net.

Add comment next to arguments so that one can easily read the method call without getting lost in a who's who since there are quite some arguments to pass.

      This is a simple solution for implementing wildcard replacements in your asp.net pages. You may use this, if you want to replace some tokens / merge codes in the asp.net generated html by your personalized values. System.Web.UI.Control has a virtual method called 'Render' of the following signature - protected internal virtual void Render( HtmlTextWriter writer )
Since, all your ASP.Net pages and server controls are subclasses of this Control class, you can override this method and manipulate the html that's rendered from this control.

      In SQL Server, a SQL statement like 'NULL=NULL' evaluates to false. however 'NULL IS NULL' evaluates to true. So, for NULL values in your database columns, you need to use the 'IS' operator instead of the regular '=' operator.
The problem is, in Linq to SQL, there is no such 'IS' operator since 'IS' is already used as a C# language keyword. So, when you are invoking an equality check in your Linq to SQL where clause to a nullable column you need to be alert on this behavior.

      Usually static variables holds the same value for all the threads running at the same AppDommain.

In this way you may attain a thread specific or thread scoped storage to use in your application.

[assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("Mocks")]
[assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("MockObjects")]
Where are the two assemblies? I found that these two assemblies are dynamically created by NMock2 for mocking your interfaces.

      When using static programming languages such as Java, often time I have seen people writing methods that accept Object as a parameter. These methods typically don't really work on any Object, but works with multiple types of classes that don't have any common base class. Here's an example of such a method:
As you can see in this example, the process method actually expects one of CleanFloor or LaunchRocket instances.

      Private methods, when used meaningfully, are a great tool for writing beautiful object oriented code. But as many other things in life, excess of private methods is bad, too!
In my opinion, we use private methods to:
1. &nbsp;isolate a block of code to be reused inside the class.
2. &nbsp;extract code from another method for code readability.
Now, taking these two use cases in mind, here's an easy conclusion:

[assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("Mocks")]
[assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("MockObjects")]
Where are the two assemblies? I found that these two assemblies are dynamically created by NMock2 for mocking your interfaces.

A typical void method without any parameter looks like the following
public void DoSomething()

I think, Nightly build is an anti-pattern for Continuous Integration. If you are integrating continuously, then you shouldn't need a nightly build, that would be too discrete :(
If you already have a per-commit continuous integration setup, you shouldn't need the so called nightly build unless there's something bad about the code.
Often times, builds taking &gt;10 minutes are put in the bucket of nightly builds.
Some people put batch processing related tests under such nightly builds.

Yet, I have found that people actually starts finding it cool once they have written some test codes and stuck at a point where it offers the 'Challenge' to really write a clean and concise test code.

      I have been to a situation where only a small number of classes had been declared as public classes in an assembly. And most of the classes are declared as internal, because I wanted to expose only the public classes to the consumers of my assembly.
However, doing so creates another challenge in testing the internal classes. As we most commonly want our test codes to reside on a separate assembly so that we can leave that assembly out when we are releasing the end product.

        The Easiest and the Hardest Methods to write unit test for

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      I was wondering to find out the easiest methods to write unit tests for. I came up with a few results as the following ones...
a. A method that takes no parameter, perform calculations on only local data and always returns a constant value is the easiest to test. But the question is, is this at all important to have such methods?
b. A method that takes some parameters, and limits its operations only on the supplied parameters and local variables and returns some value or throws exception is also very easy to write a test for.

      Dissection of void Methods without parameters
Methods with void return types incur complexities in writing unit tests. So, we need to characterize the void methods to make sure we have guards against the odds for testability.
A typical void method without any parameter looks like the following
public void DoSomething()
{
//1.modifies some member variables
this.someMemberVariable = 10;
//2.Calls methods of the same class or other classes
someClass.SomeOtherMethod(someArg);
//3.Sometimes throws exception

So, in total this pattern introduces 312 lines of duplicate code without whitespaces and 644 lines of duplicate code including whitespaces. And the pattern is simple, just check a condition and throw exception if its true.

I have worked on a few rails projects and the ASP.Net MVC implementation is very much like Rails. Anyway, still early for me to comment!

      Like mine, you may also need to change a user's password from an admin account. By default, when you are using ASP.Net authentication and storing the password in the hashed format, you will not be able to see the existing password in its decrypted form. Also, to change a password using the Membership API, you will need to know the existing password. However, here is a simple solution to the problem -

      You can include javascript files using a simple script tag. However, you will soon discover that, when you are using this master page from content pages that are at different levels in folder hierarchy then the script files will be missing at some cases. This is due to the fact that, script file paths are referenced relative to the content page and NOT to the master page. As a result, despite having the correct include wrt the master page, your content pages may still miss the scripts!

      This is a simple solution for implementing wildcard replacements in your asp.net pages. You may use this, if you want to replace some tokens / merge codes in the asp.net generated html by your personalized values. System.Web.UI.Control has a virtual method called 'Render' of the following signature - protected internal virtual void Render( HtmlTextWriter writer )
Since, all your ASP.Net pages and server controls are subclasses of this Control class, you can override this method and manipulate the html that's rendered from this control.

      In a typical ASP.Net web form, we have a few controls and also validators associated with the controls. The most common validators are used for Required Field validation, Type validation, Regular Expression validation and so on.
When we want to logically group the validators in a web form, we apply the same value for ValidationGroup property on the controls of a group and in this way, we create a logical division among our controls and the validation.

So, once you decided to take small increments, make sure you reach the targets sprinting.
I suggest you prepare for sprinting with the right techniques and tools. A few recommendations-
Never miss a daily standup meeting. Spend only 2 minutes (or less) per person answering the three questions – what did you do yesterday, what’s on the plate for today and what is blocking the race?

        Lesson#2: Pace Your Sprint Rightly

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      In my previous post, I said about being incremental. Here come the next thing, being “ITERATIVE”. A prefer the term Sprint than Iteration.
So, once you decided to take small increments, make sure you reach the targets sprinting.
I suggest you prepare for sprinting with the right techniques and tools. A few recommendations-
Never miss a daily standup meeting. Spend only 2 minutes (or less) per person answering the three questions – what did you do yesterday, what’s on the plate for today and what is blocking the race?

“We have 13 projects running at this moment. We are working our heart out. But, we are not finding any time to do Test Driven Development, Continuous Integration and all the good things…”
Well, I understand how it feels! As the title says, “Its easier to get lost!

      As Scrum and Agile processes tell you, do it in small sprints, 2 weeks preferably, and go incremental. Take a small piece at a time and sprint. I took this image from internet and credits to this site.
It’s easy to work out the Natural way than to defy it! If you are iterative and incremental, you are reaching towards the right hand side of the image! And to make the evolution faster, I suggest you try out Scrumming with ScrumPad.

Good
I am pair programming on the ScrumPad project now and the feeling in general is good. I have this perception is the work quality is better than doing alone. Also, the amount of time wasted to find small issues are now much reduced. Overall, its good.
Productivity Increased
I definitely found the productivity boosted by a factor of 1.

      Up to now, I have figured out that teams trying to behave agile sometimes fall into the cave of pretending to be agile (e.g. stand up meetings and less than just enough planning and short iterations so on!). Often, when this pretending takes places for days, it creates a illusion on the minds of the people that they might be doing the "right thing". And all on a sudden, someone discovers things are breaking and there is no way out of this disaster!

1. Management aspects.
2. Technical aspects.
1. Management aspects
I encapsulate the things like working on a story by story basis, standing up for daily status update meeting, producing deliveries in short iterations and without much of prior planning into this group.

      The System.Xml.Linq.XDocument.ToString() produces a serialized string version of the XDocument object. But unfortunately, while doing so, it leaves the xml declaration in the serialized version which may be required in your application.
Again, there is another method called Save that produces the serialized version including xml declaration. So, I think we can write a simple extension method for producing the xml declaration as shown in the following -
