      When using static programming languages such as Java, often time I have seen people writing methods that accept Object as a parameter. These methods typically don't really work on any Object, but works with multiple types of classes that don't have any common base class. Here's an example of such a method:
As you can see in this example, the process method actually expects one of CleanFloor or LaunchRocket instances.

      Private methods, when used meaningfully, are a great tool for writing beautiful object oriented code. But as many other things in life, excess of private methods is bad, too!
In my opinion, we use private methods to:
1. &nbsp;isolate a block of code to be reused inside the class.
2. &nbsp;extract code from another method for code readability.
Now, taking these two use cases in mind, here's an easy conclusion:

        Unit/Functional Test Rails ActionController filters following DRY

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      At ScrumPad most of our controllers are bounded by filters for authentication/authorization. Some filters apply to all actions in a controller while others apply to only a few or leave out only a few. However, since we are following TDD, we need to test the filter is invoked before each of the desired action. This makes the test code MOIST (not DRY)!
Example of Moist Code:
The following example only captures two test methods.

StoryDescopeNotAllowedError
StoryCompleteError

StoryDeleteNotAllowedErrorThese exceptions are really useful in my application. But the bad thing is, they all derive from StandardError class, whereas there should be a base class, may be StoryError, which is more meaningful and useful. So, we can have the following-

The Problem/Job in Hand
Add an action switch_project to all the controllers (&gt; 20) of the ScrumPad code base. The implementations of the switch_project method will be same for all the controllers only other than the fact that, the switching destination will be different.

      I have been doing TDD for about two years now and using mock testing for interaction based unit testing in my projects. What I have learned over this time is, a unit testable design leads to introduction of interfaces and dependency injection for testing a code in isolation. And when I want to perform tests on my interactions, I need to create mock objects and inject these mock instances to my object under test.

- I think Ninject can save a lot of coding and debugging time.
- This is a cool framework :-) with a fun-to-read documentation.
- It uses simple conventions and Attributes for resolving most dependencies behind the scene.
- You can take full advantage to lambda expressions for writing compact codes.
Today, I took a look into this Ninject framework.

      Recently I was writing unit test for a method of the following signature

and I wanted to verify the following call -
Insert("key", "value", DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(30), TimeSpan.Zero);
However, you readily see the problem in verifying with the above call for the presence of DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(30) in the argument. So, a test method like the following won't work for obvious reason.

      Yesterday I badly needed to create mocks for my internal interfaces. I am using NMock2 as a Mocking framework and found it really difficult to produce Mocks for internal interfaces. After some 'google time' and investigation I found that you need the following two lines in your AssemblyInfo.cs to achieve this purpose-
[assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("Mocks")]
[assembly: InternalsVisibleTo("MockObjects")]
Where are the two assemblies? I found that these two assemblies are dynamically created by NMock2 for mocking your interfaces.

      Dissection of void Methods without parameters
Methods with void return types incur complexities in writing unit tests. So, we need to characterize the void methods to make sure we have guards against the odds for testability.
A typical void method without any parameter looks like the following
public void DoSomething()
{
//1.modifies some member variables
this.someMemberVariable = 10;
//2.Calls methods of the same class or other classes
someClass.SomeOtherMethod(someArg);
//3.Sometimes throws exception
