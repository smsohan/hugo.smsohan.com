Context is everything. Due to a context mismatch projects such as exporting democracy, agile transformations, building startups, losing weight, mindfulness or anything you can think of fail to repeat.
Context is formed by why / what / who / when / where / how, each of these being a critcial part. Most often it&rsquo;s common to focus on the how alone - forgetting the rest of the context while adopting a recipe for success in business.

First, mangoes are in-season, and I still remember the juicy sweetness of the mango I had just the night before. So, when the coach asked each of us to be a fruit, I didn&rsquo;t think twice. One of my coworkers was a kiwi, another one apple, and so on. The idea was to group us by color, then by size. This got us, twenty people in the class, moving and engaged.

      I have finally been able to attend a RailsConf, the 2015 edition was my first ever. And I got to say hi to people like @dhh, @wycats, and many more. Thanks Cisco for sponsoring this trip.
The attendance on the conference was totally amazing, heaven knows how many, but it looked like a couple thousands of rails developers attended the @dhh keynote. And @dhh delivered a good one. Unlike the last year&rsquo;s talk, this year it didn&rsquo;t cause a huge noise because it was mostly about announcing new features of rails to be released with Rails 5.

      This fall semester, I signed for the Entrepreneurship and Innovation course (ENTI 781) at the Haskyne Business School of University of Calgary. Wanted to capture my thoughts on this course for my readers here.
First, the course was unconventional since there are very little academic material to teach entrepreneurship and innovation. The teacher, Olga Petricevic, did a decent job of collecting materials comprising of academic papers, case studies, newspaper articles and YouTube videos as well as bringing in a local entrepreneur for a lecture one day.

      2013 was an amazing year in many ways for my personal life. To recap, the top story of 2013 was of course the birth of our son, Shopoth. And then, we bought our first house, paid off our car-loan and ended the year with a much needed vacation, that too to Bangladesh where we spent some quality time with the families.
2013 was my year of learning Haskell. I can&rsquo;t claim to be a seasoned Haskell programmer yet.

      I like the idea of learning one new programming language every year. This is also mentioned at The Pragmatic Programmer Book. I&rsquo;m now looking for a new language to learn.
In 2011, I learned F#, my first functional programming language experience. It&rsquo;s a really nice language, especially if you&rsquo;re familiar with the .Net class library and the windows development echo system in general. This was really fun, learned the basic concepts and building blocks of functional languages.

      Any kind of configuration file, be it an ugly xml file or a prettier yml or properties file, its been a source of frustration to me. Here's a list of few such pain points:
There are two config keys that point to the same value. e.g. db_username=master, data_source_user=masterThere are two config keys for urls that point to the same domain, but different paths. e.g. market.com/cameras and market.com/undiesConfig entries with placeholders.

        How Not To Provide Feedback When Doing Code Review

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Code review, as any other review process, can often be an attack on someone's ego and incite anger and frustration. Being both on sending and receiving end of such code reviews for years, I have learned a few how-not-to-do-it, or as one might say, anti-patterns of providing code review feedback. Let me know if you agree/disagree with me on the following:
You are always reviewing Adam's code while Adam is never reviewing yours.

User Experience: I find a good user experience is THE thing that you want in anything you design, and if you are writing a software, its even more important. After I read a few books, I have a feeling that its not just a common sense approach, it takes some education and a deep care to produce something usable.

      If you are anything like me, you love using the home and end key to quickly move to the start/end of a line of text. But, in Apple MacBook Pro, there is no default home/end key! I searched the internet and found Command + Left/Right to the rescue on OS X.
But, then I installed windows 7 on my Mac and it was nightmare to edit without the home/end keys.

      If you are like me, with little creativity with UI (!), on a new project you always start with a simple layout, banner followed by a row of menu and then a two column body that ends with a footer. Well, here is an example:-----------------------------------------------------------CampZero zero hassle camping----------------------------------------------------------Home | Place a booking----------------------------------------------------------Welcome | | | | | | --------------------------------------------------------- Campzero.com, all rights reserved---------------------------------------------------------Well, there are other ways and you will almost always see good visual elements in most websites.

      Today is going to be my last day with the Code71 team and this is the last post of the series on my Code71 days.
The journey started on June 1, 2006 and now at this moment, I just wanted to summarize my takehome from the last three years' of work. I will go short, just touching the bits...Teaming is at the core of Code71's culture. It went beyond teaming just for software development as we met outside for a movie, celebrated even the smallest of personal achievements and shared the excitement of a cricket or tennis match even at midnight from home over phone!

      In my previous post, I got a bit nostalgic! However, ever since I posted the first one, I was looking for another post on the series. Trying to capture what I learned during the past 3 years, I found it would be really time taking for me and my readers. So, I sort of compiled the following list in this post. Hope it helps someone who is just eager to learn about software.

      Sighs!
Back then, on Friday, May 26, 2006, I was a final year undergrad student at CSE, BUET. I was looking for a part-time software dev job opportunity and found a little one page advert for a student job at asha-technologies (lately renamed as Code71). Visited their website and thought it might be worth giving a try!
As usual, I was interviewed over phone and enjoyed a long 2 hour interview on premise.

      For the last few months, I am on the lookout for a really good syntax highlighter that helps me to post blogs on all the programming languages in a pretty html with syntax coloring/highlighting. This one is taken from http://alexgorbatchev.com/wiki/SyntaxHighlighter
Ruby/Rails class TestHighlighter
def my_highlighter
return "SyntaxHighlighter"
end
end
CSharp
public class TestHighlighter
{
public string MyHighlighter

get {return "SyntaxHighlighter";}

        Preserve Ownership, mode and other attributes while copying in Linux

      I dare not say, I am savvy at Linux :-)
Recently, I ran into a problem where I found that upon executing a copy command, my source and destination files had different permissions and attributes (i-nodes), but I badly needed the permissions to be preserved in the destination files/folders. The following command will preserve the attributes -
cp -p source destination here, the switch p (-p) does the trick, it preserves the permissions, modes and other attributes to resemble the source.
