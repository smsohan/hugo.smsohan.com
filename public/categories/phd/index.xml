Family, friends, and colleagues are all sending their wishes, and it feels great to have crossed this milestone.
To be honest, deep inside, I carry a sad and guilty feeling, which at times overshadows the feeling of acomplishment. This phenomenon is hard to write about, but I wanted to give it a try anyway.
