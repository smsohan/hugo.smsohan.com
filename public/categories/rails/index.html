    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Introducing Asset Pipeline to an old project is quite hard. Most pre-asset pipeline projects used small JavaScript/CSS files that are often scoped to a single page or a part of the application. A typical example is as follows:
$(function(){ $(&#39;#login&#39;).on(&#39;click&#39;, function(){ var isLoginValid = hasValue($(&#39;#user_name&#39;)) &amp;&amp; hasValue($(&#39;#user_password&#39;)); if(isLoginValid){ $(&#39;#login_errors&#39;).hide(); $(&#39;#login_form&#39;).submit(); } else { $(&#39;#login_errors&#39;).show(); return false; } }); }); Now, within the scope of the login page this code executes just fine.

In a nutshell, with this gem in your application, all you need to do is this:
Class ExportsController def index stream_csv(&#39;data.csv&#39;, MyModel.header_row) do |rows| MyModel.find_each do |my_model| rows &lt;&lt; my_model.to_csv_row end end end end Find more at https://github.com/smsohan/streamy_csv

      The question is, should we use the third-party ActiveRecord Query Enhancers like SearchLogic/Squeel/MetaSearch?
Quoting from Squeel&rsquo;s Github README page,
Squeel lets you rewrite... Article.where [&#39;created_at &gt;= ?&#39;, 2.weeks.ago] ...as... Article.where{created_at &gt;= 2.weeks.ago} This is a good thing. If you don&#39;t agree, Squeel might not be for you. At work, we are migrating a Rails 3.0 project into Rails 3.2. We used MetaSearch in the project quite extensively and now discussing if using Squeel (successor of MetaSearch for newer Rails versions) would be a good decision.

      I didn't even notice this little trick! As long as I didn't have to call deliver_welcome_message (or deliver_*) methods that would magically call welcome_message, I was happy that now the magic is gone. Things are transparent!
Here's an example showing the change: Say you have the following mailer:
class Notifier &lt; ActionMailer::Base
def welcome_message(new_user)
#a warm welcome message
end
endNow, prior to Rails 3, or ActionMailer 3, you would write the following to actually call this method to get the benefits of ActionMailer magics, such as finding the view based on method name and so on:

API_KEY or a token to identify/authenticate an API call.Authentication of an API caller using the API_KEY.Authlogic comes with in-built support for this.

I was reviewing a Ruby on Rails source code to see the security implementations they have so far. They are about to launch their product for the first release and wanted to ensure they have the most obvious things checked. So, in a sense it was not supposed to be a hacking job for me, rather to check if the most well known security measures are in place.

Ruby is a self-sustained language. As a language this is completely ignorant of the Rails Framework. So, I think there is no dependency from Ruby to Rails.

      I was taking a look into the fresh ActiveModel module of Rails 3 as of github revision #100644. Here is what I learned:
Learned about new feature called autoload. Rails Inside has a small yet useful autoload example here. It is a mechanism to lazy load your modules, so delaying the load unless the module methods are actually called. A call to autoload simply marks it as a potential include, but the actual include takes place only when you first use something on that module.

      According to google's SEO guideline, its a good idea to provide breadcrumbs to your web contents. This is good in two ways: a) It helps people to find path to move up the navigation stack and b) it helps the google and other search engines to get a feel about your web content's hierarchical organization.To add this breadcrumbs support, in my application www.campzero.com, a going to be online service marketplace for Bangladesh, I simply used the Crummy plugin.

      When talking about Search Engine Optimization for your public web pages, you probably try to follow the google guidelines for search engine optimization. Its a good one to get started with. For my recent project, www.campzero.com, I read the document and tried to follow the steps. Today, I worked on generating sitemap for www.campzero.com using the following:Installed the site-map generator plugin following this link at Aktagon's, github linkFor some reason, probably because of permission issues, my plugin install didn't generate the sample sitemap.

      Rails models are no exception compared to the super models! You are in the business if and only if you got a good physical structure and can stick to it for years...
At Code71, we are keeping our rails models attractive following a few guidelines. I will be posting these guidelines in a series and here goes the first one - about the physical structure of the ruby on rails models.

      Naming conventions play an important role to the software's overall architecture. It is not a rocket science, still, it may lead to unhappy consequences if not taken care of at the early stage of a project. This small best practices can make a code base significantly improved.
Rails does a good job by using the dynamic power of ruby and providing with a handful of dynamic methods with the models.

      In most web applications, breadcrumbs offer a nice way to trace back to previously visited pages. However, generating the breadcrumbs and showing them on dynamic pages sometimes need special care for the following reasons-
The links of the breadcrumb may contain dynamic links. It is used in all the pages. So, changing the breadcrumb may trigger a series of changes. In ScrumPad, we are using ruby on rails. There are a few plugins to help rails projects in managing breadcrumbs, but none seemed to satisfy our need.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      At ScrumPad most of our controllers are bounded by filters for authentication/authorization. Some filters apply to all actions in a controller while others apply to only a few or leave out only a few. However, since we are following TDD, we need to test the filter is invoked before each of the desired action. This makes the test code MOIST (not DRY)!
Example of Moist Code:
The following example only captures two test methods.

StorySaveError
StoryDescopeNotAllowedError
StoryCompleteError
StoryNotFoundError
StoryDeleteError
StoryDeleteNotAllowedErrorThese exceptions are really useful in my application. But the bad thing is, they all derive from StandardError class, whereas there should be a base class, may be StoryError, which is more meaningful and useful. So, we can have the following-

      To avoid the n+1 problem, you need to use eager loading in ActiveRecord object associations. An easy implementation of eager loading can be done using named scope in the following way.
class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
has_many :friends
named_scope :eager_load_friends, :include =&gt; :fiends
end
User.find(user_id).eager_load_friendsTo unit test the named scope, you can use this following helper method (keep it in test_helper.rb, if you like) that I wrote for ScrumPad

The Problem/Job in Hand
Add an action switch_project to all the controllers (&gt; 20) of the ScrumPad code base. The implementations of the switch_project method will be same for all the controllers only other than the fact that, the switching destination will be different.

      In doing rails unit testing, sometime you need to assert the equality between two float objects in the following fashion
assert_equal 32.8, object_under_test.method_returning_float
The internal storage of float objects sometimes will contain 32.8 with additional lower precision decimal points and hence the assert may fail although the significant digits may be same. For example, the value of object_under_test.method_returning_float may be stored as 32.80000001 in memory and the above call may fail.
