This is definitely the greatest show on earth and I have been all occupied with the matches...
However, the show started almost immediately after I was back from Europe. It was a nice tour, starting a day at Amsterdam. Then to Trondheim (Norway), Stockholm and the best part was the night long sea cruise to Helsinki. An experience to remember for the rest of my life.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/2010/05/03/summer-of-2010-europe-here-we-come/ class="link black dim">Summer of 2010!

API_KEY or a token to identify/authenticate an API call.Authentication of an API caller using the API_KEY.Authlogic comes with in-built support for this.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/2010/03/31/flashnow-did-you-know/ class="link black dim">flash.now - did you know?</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Well, I didn't know this until late.

Well, as you have thought, the Ruby on Rails people have solved this problem way before now. The solution is to wisely use flash.now[] and flash[].</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/2010/03/23/whats-up-next/ class="link black dim">What's up next?</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Hello Readers:
Wish you all are doing great as the Spring already started :-)
Recently my grad courses are keeping me busy with assignments and projects as the term comes close to an end. So, I haven't had much time to spend on blogging other than posting the Ruby on Rails link blog called www.DrinkRails.com. However, for my readers, I thought I would post the recent presentation that I put for the Agile course here:</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/2010/03/11/ruby-on-rails-security-review/ class="link black dim">Ruby on Rails Security Review: An Experience Report</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Image credits to Wink&nbsp;on Flickr (creative commons)
I was reviewing a Ruby on Rails source code to see the security implementations they have so far. They are about to launch their product for the first release and wanted to ensure they have the most obvious things checked. So, in a sense it was not supposed to be a hacking job for me, rather to check if the most well known security measures are in place.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/2010/03/09/ruby-on-rails-or-rails-on-ruby/ class="link black dim">Ruby on Rails or Rails on Ruby?</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">All on a sudden, this thing popped up in my mind. What we are calling Ruby on Rails, is this actually "Ruby" on "Rails" or the other way around? Is this upside down? Here's my mental picture of the RoR framework:

Ruby is a self-sustained language. As a language this is completely ignorant of the Rails Framework. So, I think there is no dependency from Ruby to Rails.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/2010/02/26/rails-source-code-walkthrough-1/ class="link black dim">Rails Source Code Walkthrough #1: the ActiveModel Module</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I was taking a look into the fresh ActiveModel module of Rails 3 as of github revision #100644. Here is what I learned:
Learned about new feature called autoload. Rails Inside has a small yet useful autoload example here. It is a mechanism to lazy load your modules, so delaying the load unless the module methods are actually called. A call to autoload simply marks it as a potential include, but the actual include takes place only when you first use something on that module.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/2010/02/25/why-would-you-spend-10-to-learn-to-use/ class="link black dim">Why would you spend $10 to learn to use Basecamp?</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">This is sounding very strange to me indeed! 37Signals is very much known for creating the simplest of interfaces and I really found people finding it very intuitive.
