I’ve been in search of a new job for the past few months. Thanks to my recruiters and interviewers, I’ve received some useful feedback. Many thanks to them for this gift.
``Needs more energy&rsquo;&rsquo; - This was the most memorable feedback I got. It was from the VP of a company. My interview with him was the last of the five on the same day.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/2020/09/15/context/ class="link black dim">Context</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Image credits to NCinDC
Context is everything. Due to a context mismatch projects such as exporting democracy, agile transformations, building startups, losing weight, mindfulness or anything you can think of fail to repeat.
Context is formed by why / what / who / when / where / how, each of these being a critcial part. Most often it&rsquo;s common to focus on the how alone - forgetting the rest of the context while adopting a recipe for success in business.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/2020/08/31/change/ class="link black dim">Change</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Manager&rsquo;s Mind As managers, we have the benefit of view because we have our eyes on longer term goals. To achieve those goals, we often have to introduce a change. For example, we may want to change how a team is formed or what product a team works on based on new business needs or opportunities. So, we put a lot of thought into it and propose our plan to the team hoping the following reaction:</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/2020/07/17/when-i-applied-kon-mari-to-my-calendar/ class="link black dim">When I Applied KonMari to My Calendar</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">“I&rsquo;d like to tidy up the entire planet.

Well, she came to my work calendar in spirit. Let’s start with some backstory.
When I was developer, my typical day looked like this: one standup meeting and then pretty much the rest of the day in coding. Sometimes I paired up or jumped on a whiteboard session with my coworkers to hash things out.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/2020/05/18/engineering-management-and-diagnosing-low-performance/ class="link black dim">People Management and Diagnosing Low Performance</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Beginning with a story here. Back in 2008, I was a couple of years out of college and working for a software company in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Like many of my classmates from my college, I was studying GRE alongside my job for a PhD admission in a reputable US university. That process being long and uncertain, I also applied for an MBA program at the University of Dhaka as a backup plan.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/2020/02/28/i-just-love-to-read-code/ class="link black dim">I Just Love to Read Code</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">This week I took a couple of days to focus on my mid-thirties. It got me thinking about what I actually love doing as a hobby. The list is fairly small, walks with the family, soccer, tennis, coffee with friends, reading, writing, car videos, and Netflix.
Thinking about how I spend my idle time, I realized that I missed two things that I actually love and spend a fair amount of time on: stock markets and reading open-source code.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/blog/2020/02/08/working-with-me/ class="link black dim">Working With Me</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Since I commonly work with a diverse group of people, this post is a way for me to broadcast some quick tricks that may help our working relationship.

Trust is only earned when it&rsquo;s mutual. Let&rsquo;s work with this shared belief.
Context is everything. Most importantly, show me why we need to work on something.

But the question is, is it worth and should your team solve these problems? Especially, for small teams?

Ix-Chel Ruiz presented the keynote to start the day.
